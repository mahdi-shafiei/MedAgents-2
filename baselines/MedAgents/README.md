We propose a **Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC)** framework. The framework works in five stages: 
(i) expert gathering: gather experts from distinct disciplines according to the clinical question;
(ii) analysis proposition: domain experts put forward their own analysis with their expertise;
(iii) report summarization: compose a summarized report on the basis of a previous series of analyses;
(iv) collaborative consultation: engage the experts in discussions over the summarized report. The report will be revised iteratively until an agreement from all the experts is reached;
(v) decision making: derive a final decision from the unanimous report.

## Requirements

Install all required python dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

We evaluate our MC framework on two benchmark datasets MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA, as well as six subtasks most relevant to the medical domain from MMLU datasets including anatomy, clinical knowledge, college medicine, medical genetics, professional medicine, and college biology.

## Implementations
Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key. Install the `dotenv` package:
```
pip install python-dotenv
```

The `.env` file should look like this:
```
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://azure-openai-miblab-ncu.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_API_KEY=<your_azure_api_key>
AZURE_API_VERSION=2024-08-01-preview
```

Run the following command to run the experiments:
```
bash run_experiments_medqa.sh       # for MedQA
bash run_experiments_mmlu.sh        # for MMLU (TODO)
```
