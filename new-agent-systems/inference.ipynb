Lung and heart auscultation are without audible abnormalities. The physician orders a thyroid panel to determine if that patient has hypothyroidism.

Physicians should maintain detailed information about previous vaccina tions received by each individual, including type of vaccination, date of receipt, and adverse events, if any, following vaccination. Information should also include the person's history of vaccine-preventable illnesses, occupation, and lifestyle. Vaccine histories ideally should be based on written documentation to ascertain whether vaccines and toxoids were administered at appropriate ages and at proper intervals.

Isolated posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injuries are uncommon and can be easily missed with physical examination. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of the clinical, diagnostic and arthroscopic evaluation of a PCL injured knee. There are some specific injury mechanisms that can cause a PCL including the dashboard direct anterior blow and hyperflexion mechanisms. During the diagnostic process it is important to distinguish between an isolated or multiligament injury and whether the problem is acute or chronic. Physical examination can be difficult in an acutely injured knee because of pain and swelling, but there are specific functional tests that can indicate a PCL tear. Standard x-ray's and stress views are very useful imaging modalities\n",

    "Query: A 4-year-old male is accompanied by his mother to the pediatrician. His mother reports that over the past two weeks, the child has had intermittent low grade fevers and has been more lethargic than usual. The child’s past medical history is notable for myelomeningocele complicated by lower extremity weakness as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction. He has been hospitalized multiple times at an outside facility for recurrent urinary tract infections. The child is in the 15th percentile for both height and weight. His temperature is 100.7°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. Physical examination is notable for costovertebral angle tenderness that is worse on the right. Which of the following would most likely be found on biopsy of this patient’s kidney? A) Mononuclear and eosinophilic infiltrate B) Replacement of renal parenchyma with foamy histiocytes C) Destruction of the proximal tubule and medullary thick ascending limb D) Tubular colloid casts with diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate\n",
    "Passage: The natural history of urinary infection in adults. The vast majority of otherwise healthy adults with anatomically and functionally normal urinary tracts experience few untoward long-term consequences from symptomatic or asymptomatic UTIs. Effective early treatment of symptomatic infection rapidly curtails bacterial invasion and the resulting inflammatory response. Rarely, uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis causes suppuration and renal scarring. Urinary infections in patients with renal calculi, obstructed urinary tract, neurogenic bladder, or diabetes are frequently much more destructive and have ongoing sequelae. Strategies to treat both the infection and the complications are often necessary to alter this outcome.\n",
