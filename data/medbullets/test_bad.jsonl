While it does not lower mortality, it may reduce symptoms of heart failure. Digoxin toxicity classically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea/vomiting), blurred vision or yellow halos, and cardiac dysrhythmias. While there is a myriad of dysrhythmias, digoxin can cause bradycardia, atrioventricular block, and premature ventricular contractions. ST-segment scooping can be seen with digoxin use both in toxicity but also with regular therapeutic use. Toxicity is treated with anti-digoxin antibodies.\n\nPatocka et al review digoxin toxicity.

Crystal deposition in the joint space leads to an intense inflammatory reaction that causes severe pain and joint effusion. Gout is most commonly due to lifestyle factors including a diet high in red meat and alcohol. Medications that cause elevated uric acid levels (such as thiazide diuretics) may also play a role. Conditions resulting in high cell turnover and therefore excessive purine release such as hematologic malignancies may also lead to the development of gout. Patients typically present with sudden-onset, severe pain, erythema, and joint effusion. Synovial fluid analysis will reveal an elevated leukocyte count and negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals. Treatment of acute gout is with NSAID medications, colchicine, or steroids depending on presentation and patient-specific factors. Prevention of further attacks is centered around lifestyle changes such as avoidance of red meat and alcohol. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors such as allopurinol are also often used for prevention of further episodes.\n\nNeogi discusses the management of acute gout. She comments that, while synovial fluid analysis is the gold standard of diagnosis, many physicians do not routinely perform it, instead relying on clinical judgment to diagnose gout.

The patient\u2019s ECG reveals deep, pathologic Q waves, which in this case are an incidental finding indicative of a previous myocardial infarction or a previous ischemic event.\n\nThe Q wave is a negative deflection just prior to the R wave. Q waves are a normal finding when they are small and are seen on most ECGs. However, pathologic Q waves are indicative of myocardial ischemia. Pathologic Q waves are generally diagnosed when they are >2 mm deep, >1 mm wide, >25% of the QRS complex height, or are seen in leads V1-V3. The interpretation of Q waves depends on other findings on ECG and the patient's symptoms. Deep Q waves in the setting of ST elevation indicate an acute myocardial infarction. On the other hand, pathologic Q waves found incidentally indicate a previous myocardial infarction or previous ischemic event.\n\nRovai et al. review Q waves. They discuss how Q waves can be used to predict the location and size of a myocardial infarction as correlated with MRI.

His steatorrhea can be improved with the administration of proton pump inhibitors such as pantoprazole.\n\nChronic pancreatitis is a sequela that occurs after repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. It can occur secondary to alcoholism or gallstones, and it may present with chronic abdominal pain, hypocalcemia, and signs of malnutrition and weight loss. Malnutrition and weight loss occur secondary to the pancreas\u2019 inability to produce pancreatic enzymes which leads to poor nutrient absorption. Lack of lipase can lead to fat wasting in the stool, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, and K). The management of chronic pancreatitis is the cessation of the underlying cause, pancreatic enzyme replacement, and the administration of proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors help with steatorrhea by increasing the pH as low pH inactivates pancreatic enzymes.\n\nSingh et al. review the diagnosis and management of chronic pancreatitis. The authors find that the diagnosis can be secured by typical findings on CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy. The authors recommend the use of endoscopic ultrasound in securing the diagnosis in patients with equivocal imaging findings and a high index of suspicion, such as patients with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a CT scan of the abdomen demonstrating calcifications and chronic inflammatory injury (red arrows) suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone is the appropriate management of infectious diarrhea from a bacterial organism. This usually presents with fever, as well as bloody or purulent diarrhea. In general, young and healthy patients who are able to hydrate themselves should not be given antibiotics, even for infectious diarrhea. Elderly patients, immunosuppressed patients, or patients with symptoms that do not improve spontaneously should be managed with a stool culture and antibiotics.\n\nAnswer B: Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal agent that could be used for irritable bowel syndrome to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms of diarrhea. Loperamide and other antidiarrheals should never be used for infectious causes of diarrhea as they will delay the fecal shedding of the organism or virus and could prolong symptoms.\n\nAnswer C: Oral rehydration is recommended for any patient with diarrhea and signs of volume depletion and is preferred to IV fluids as the integrity of the gut is protected.

The most appropriate next step in management is urgent endoscopic removal of the battery.\n\nButton batteries are commonly used in watches and small electronic devices. If these objects are ingested (usually by children), they can become lodged in the esophagus. Coughing, drooling, and chest discomfort are classic symptoms but a lack of symptoms does not negate the need for evaluation if suspicion is high. The location of the battery can be confirmed by radiograph and orthogonal views can localize the object in the esophagus versus the trachea. Endoscopy is the preferred method of removal as direct visualization of any associated esophageal injury is possible. The battery can cause ulceration or perforation if left in the esophagus due to chemical extravasation.\n\nBaharudin et al. review a number of cases of pediatric ingestions resulting in esophageal lodging.

Figure/Illustration B is a lateral chest radiograph demonstrating that the battery is posterior to the trachea (red circle). This view confirms that the location of the battery is in the esophagus.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon catheter removal can be attempted for ingested button batteries but is typically used only if endoscopy is not available. There is more potential for tissue damage without direct visualization, so ingestion time greater than 2 hours is generally a contraindication for this method.\n\nAnswer B: Ipecac administration can induce emesis and is rarely used for toxic ingestions. Vomiting can cause further lodging in the esophagus and even more tissue damage. Ipecac is therefore not recommended in the modern management of toxic ingestions.\n\nAnswer D: Observation would be appropriate if there is an ingested object that has already traveled further into the gastrointestinal tract (if they are small and smooth), as these objects would likely pass on their own. A classic example would be a coin ingestion that would appear as a single round object rather than a double ring appearance. A button battery in the esophagus is an emergency and should be removed urgently.\n\nAnswer E: Surgical extraction of a battery with associated repair may be required if there is suspicion of an esophageal-vascular fistula, mediastinitis, or other such complications.

The most likely laboratory abnormalities are elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), high anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), low sodium, and low potassium.\n\nHeart failure is characterized by the decreased performance of the cardiac ventricles resulting in ventricular dilation. As the ventricles dilate, they release BNP as a marker of stretching of myocardial tissue. BNP levels can therefore serve as a marker of CHF. The kidneys will also have decreased perfusion levels in this disease leading to several key physiologic changes. First, is the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which serves to increase perfusion to the kidneys by increasing blood pressure. This system achieves increased blood pressure by maintaining sodium and fluid retention at the expense of decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and decreased hydronium ions (metabolic alkalosis). In addition, ADH is also increased to further increase perfusion, resulting in water retention, hemodilution, and hyponatremia.\n\nMa et al. studied the correlation between BNP levels and cardiovascular outcomes. They found that patients with CHF and high levels of BNP had increased rates of cardiovascular complications.

Though aldosterone serves to retain sodium, it also absorbs water. Thus, hypernatremia would not be seen. This pattern could be seen in patients with heart failure who have high free water losses such as after a burn or in desert environments.\n\nAnswer B: High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the appropriate increase in ADH and subsequent decrease in sodium that would be seen in CHF. Patients who have diabetes insipidus can have low ADH in this setting resulting in loss of free water.\n\nAnswer D: Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium does not reflect the finding of elevated BNP that is classically found in the dilated ventricles of CHF.

Patients often present with symptoms that include headache, blurry vision, and tinnitus. Fundoscopic examination typically reveals bilateral papilledema. Vision loss is a complication of this condition with high morbidity. While there is no identifiable cause, common associations include obesity or a recent increase in weight as well as medications such as isotretinoin - a vitamin A derivative that is often used in the management of severe nodulocystic acne vulgaris. Management should first involve imaging of the brain (CT or MRI) to exclude elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure due to other causes such as brain tumor, dural sinus thrombosis, or hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is made via lumbar puncture revealing increased opening pressure. Lumbar puncture can also result in therapeutic relief.

Given his persistent hypotension, he should be started on vasopressors of which norepinephrine is first line and epinephrine is second line.\n\nSeptic shock is a life-threatening, systemic bacterial infection that leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Early management is centered on IV fluids, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and workup to uncover the source. If the patient's blood pressure does not respond to IV fluids (by definition, their blood pressure will not respond to fluids in septic shock), vasopressors should be started with a goal mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg. The first line vasopressor is norepinephrine, which can be titrated up for maximal effect. If this vasopressor fails to reach blood pressure goals, then the next vasopressor is either vasopressin or epinephrine (either is acceptable). If the second line vasopressor fails to increase blood pressure, then the third line vasopressor is vasopressin or epinephrine (whichever was not used as the second line pressor).

The most appropriate next step in management would be thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine ablation.\n\nPapillary thyroid carcinoma represents the majority of malignant thyroid cancers. They are slow-growing and are found in the hormone-producing follicular cells of the thyroid. Typically, these tumors are found incidentally on imaging. Risk factors for thyroid malignancy include a history of radiation exposure, female sex, and positive family history. Nodules with minimal uptake on radioactive iodine scan, firm and immobile solitary nodules, and rapidly growing nodules with associated hoarseness are more suggestive of thyroid malignancy. Findings on histology include empty-appearing nuclei with central clearing, psammoma bodies, and nuclear grooves.

This suggests a diagnosis of central retinal artery occlusion and management should focus on control of underlying risk factors given that he is 2 days out from the event.\n\nSymptoms of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) include sudden, painless, complete, and normally unilateral vision loss. A fundoscopic exam can show pallor of the optic disc, diffuse ischemic whitening of the retina, cherry-red macula, retinal edema, and constricted/bloodless retinal arterioles. The center of the macula appears red because the photoreceptor layer at the fovea is perfused by the posterior choroidal vasculature rather than the central retinal artery. Treatment involves surgical decompression of the retinal anterior chamber, ideally within 1 hour of the occlusion. Tissue plasminogen activator should be administered if the patient presents within an acceptable time frame. If surgical intervention is not readily available, additional steps with minimal evidence to support their use include ocular massage (to dislodge the embolus) and either carbogen therapy or hyperbaric oxygen. Chronic management includes control of underlying risk factors with aspirin and statin therapy.\n\nDattilo et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of central retinal artery occlusion.

This finding is characteristically seen in central retinal artery occlusion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering ranibizumab is not appropriate because this medication is an anti-VEGF antibody, which can be used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration. Symptoms of wet age-related macular degeneration include acute visual distortion and loss of central vision that occurs over months. A fundoscopic exam would show neovascularization.\n\nAnswer B: Administration of tissue plasma activator has not been shown to be beneficial in central retinal artery occlusion if the event has occurred several days ago. This medication is used in patients who sustain an ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of developing symptoms. A stroke in the posterior lobe can present with cortical hemianopsia.\n\nAnswer D: Retinal photocoagulation is used to treat diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic retinopathy, symptoms of painless vision loss present gradually. A retinal exam would show retinal hemorrhage and possibly neovascularization.\n\nAnswer E: Timolol is a beta-blocker used to treat glaucoma.

The treatment of hepatic adenomas is surgical removal and discontinuation of precipitating agents.\n\nHepatic adenomas are benign epithelial tumors that typically arise in the right hepatic lobe. They are typically solitary masses but multiple lesions can be seen in patients with prolonged contraceptive or anabolic steroid use and those who have glycogen storage disorders. Patients present with abdominal pain that is localized in the epigastrium or in the right upper quadrant. Sudden, severe abdominal pain with hypotension suggests rupture of the hepatic adenoma into the peritoneum. The lesions can be confirmed on imaging such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. For hepatic adenomas that are < 5 cm and asymptomatic, simply discontinuing the causative drug and observing are acceptable. Large or symptomatic lesions requiring surgical resection in addition to discontinuation of the offending agent. Because these tumors are highly vascular, failure to resect may result in rupture, hemoperitoneum, and shock. Biopsy is contraindicated to avoid rupturing the mass and causing hemorrhage.\n\nKlompenhouwer et al. studied the current management strategies in patients with hepatocellular adenoma.

While this amoeba can lead to a liver abscess presenting as a mass on CT, it often also causes abdominal pain and dysentery due to intestinal involvement.\n\nAnswer B: Sofosbuvir is an antiviral medication used for hepatitis C. This patient does have risk factors for hepatitis C (risky sexual behavior and intravenous drug use). Although hepatitis C could lead to hepatocellular carcinoma and cause a liver mass, this patient\u2019s presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis. Even if he did have hepatocellular carcinoma, treating hepatitis C alone without surgical resection or adjuvant therapies would be insufficient.\n\nAnswer C: Follow-up CT in 3 months would be dangerous for this man with a large hepatic adenoma. In the interim, the mass will likely continue to grow if he continues to use anabolic steroids, increasing the risk of rupture. Observation and repeat imaging may be suitable for asymptomatic hepatic lesions that are of uncertain but likely benign etiology.\n\nAnswer D: Biopsying the liver mass is appropriate if malignancy is suspected and there is no concern for hepatic adenoma.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate acts to stabilize cardiac myocyte membranes and prevent development of life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\nGupta et. al review rhabdomyolysis.

{"question": "A newborn boy is evaluated 30 minutes after birth. He was born at 39 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old primigravid mother via cesarean section for cervical insufficiency. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and the amniotic fluid was clear. Upon delivery, the patient had strong respiratory effort and a strong cry. His Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were 7 and 8, respectively. The patient now is exhibiting increased work of breathing and is progressively more tachypneic.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department after fainting while moving furniture. He states that he has been working in a hot, humid attic all day and forgot his water bottle. He felt dizzy when standing up and then fainted and was unconscious for roughly 1 minute. He awoke at his neurologic baseline afterwards. The patient has a history of hypertension being managed by his primary care doctor.

An ECG is performed and incidentally demonstrates a bifascicular block, which is at high risk of progressing to a complete heart block.\n\nBifascular block is a conduction abnormality in 2 of the 3 fascicles that conduct electricity from atria to ventricles. This leaves conduction to the ventricles via the single remaining fascicle. There are different possibilities that may present on ECG. One possibility is a right bundle branch block with a left anterior fascicular block; the other is a right bundle branch block with a left posterior fascicular block. Note that the pathophysiology of complete heart block is an inability to conduct electricity from the atria to the ventricles. If there is only 1 fascicle left to conduct electricity, the patient would be in complete heart block if this fascicle were to no longer work, which is a common outcome in patients with bifascicular block. Treatment of complete heart block involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nWiberg et al. discuss bifascicular block. They note the possible outcome of a complete heart block. It is recommended to look for this finding on ECG and appropriately workup patients to prevent progression of disease.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating bifascicular block.

It may cause complications such as stroke. Management typically involves rate control agents such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction is a likely outcome in individuals with risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, smoking, and dyslipidemia, in particular, without proper preventive measures and medical therapy including statins, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors. This patient may be at risk of a myocardial infarction with his hypertension, and his underlying bifascicular block could suggest undiagnosed cardiac ischemia; however, it is more likely this patient progresses to complete heart block in the setting of his bifascicular block.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke is a possible complication of atrial fibrillation. For this reason, most patients with atrial fibrillation are on blood thinners to prevent this complication. It occurs secondary to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium. Patients are often risk stratified prior to starting blood thinners with tools such as CHADS2VASC and HASBLED. Isolated syncope is a rare manifestation of stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Torsades des pointes is a progression from QT prolongation which may occur secondary to genetic conditions, medications, and/or infection. It presents on ECG with QRS complexes that twist in amplitude around the electrical baseline.

Patients often present with severe otalgia and purulent drainage from the external auditory canal. Granulation tissue in the external auditory canal is a characteristic exam finding.

Acute epidural hematomas are most commonly caused by damage to the middle meningeal artery from trauma to the sphenoid bone.\n\nPatients with an epidural hematoma typically have an initial loss of consciousness followed by a lucid interval, during which their mental status returns to baseline or near baseline. As the hematoma expands, patients display increasing somnolence from the increase in intracranial pressure. For that reason, epidural hematomas are sometimes referred to as the \u201ctalk and die\u201d syndrome. If not relieved, this increase in intracranial pressure can lead to uncal herniation or death. Patients with neurologic findings or those with expanding bleeds require urgent surgical decompression.\n\nDadashi et al. present cases of patients with epidural hematoma from acute trauma.

Physical exam is notable for dyspnea provoked by walking short distances. Jugular venous distension is noted on exam. The patient\u2019s blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg during inspiration. A bedside echocardiogram demonstrates impaired diastolic filling with normal ventricular contractility. An ECG is performed as seen in Figure A. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Constrictive pericarditis", "options": {"A": "Cardiac tamponade", "B": "Constrictive pericarditis", "C": "Myocardial infarction", "D": "Pulmonary embolism", "E": "Restrictive cardiomyopathy"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This patient is presenting with a preceding viral illness, dyspnea, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus (blood pressure drop from 150/85 to 130/70 mmHg during inspiration), an echocardiogram with impaired diastolic filling, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG. This constellation of symptoms is concerning for constrictive pericarditis.\n\nConstrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium becomes thickened and fibrotic. In contrast to other types of pericarditis, in constrictive pericarditis, there is impaired diastolic filling and thus impaired cardiac function. There are many possible etiologies of constrictive pericarditis including infection, inflammatory conditions, or idiopathic. Patients will present with dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, a pericardial friction rub, and positional chest pain (usually worsened by laying back and relieved by leaning forward). Patients may also demonstrate jugular venous distension, lower extremity edema, worsening dyspnea, and congestive hepatopathy. ECG may demonstrate diffuse ST elevation with PR depression, and an echocardiogram will demonstrate impaired diastolic filling and may demonstrate a thickened pericardium. The diagnosis can be supported with pulsus paradoxus (a drop of blood pressure by > 10 mmHg during inspiration).\n\nWelch reviews constrictive pericarditis. He discusses constrictive pericarditis and how the inelastic pericardium inhibits cardiac filling possibly causing unexplained heart failure. Welch notes making the diagnosis is very challenging and requires meticulous echocardiograph assessment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A demonstrates diffuse ST elevation (blue arrows) with PR depression (black arrows). This is consistent with pericarditis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiac tamponade can occur after trauma, in the setting of infection, or in the setting of autoimmune disease and is more likely to occur with a rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid. While pulsus paradoxus would be present in this condition, muffled heart sounds and electrical alternans would be more likely to be seen on ECG. Echocardiography would demonstrate an echogenic rim of fluid around the heart.\n\nAnswer C: Myocardial infarction presents with chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, and ST elevation in a vascular distribution. Note that this patient\u2019s ST elevation is diffuse and there is no reciprocal ST depression. Moreover, the pattern of chest pain in myocardial infarction is typically exertional and not positional.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary embolism may present with pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, hypoxia, hemoptysis, a history of hypercoagulability, and recent stasis or surgery (such as this patient\u2019s recent Achilles tendon surgery). It can cause obstructive shock leading to hypotension and tachycardia. Note that right heart strain and sinus tachycardia would be seen on ECG.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy presents very similarly to restrictive pericarditis. Note that in restrictive cardiomyopathy, patients will also have impaired diastolic filling; however, it is due to a myocardium that will not expand rather than the pericardium impairing filling. It can occur secondary to conditions such as amyloidosis or hemochromatosis as well as other chronic inflammatory states. The ECG findings are nonspecific but may include low voltage QRS complexes, ST segment changes, T wave changes, bundle branch blocks, and pathologic Q waves (abnormally deep and wide Q waves). The diagnosis can be supported with an ultrasound demonstrating impaired diastolic filling and possible myocardial speckling if a protein (amyloid) is present and deposited in the myocardial wall. The diagnosis can only definitively be confirmed with a biopsy which is highly invasive.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRestrictive pericarditis presents with chest pain that is positional, pulsus paradoxus, a friction rub, and diffuse ST elevation with PR depression on ECG.", "realidx": 100, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 55-year-old man with specific symptoms and medical history.

Digoxin is an appropriate medication that can both control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation and increase cardiac contractility and potentially improve respiratory symptoms in this decompensated patient with heart failure.\n\nAtrial fibrillation presents on ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm without discernible P waves. The initial management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is rate control. If the patient is stable, possible first-line agents include beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem). These agents may reduce cardiac contractility and worsen complications such as pulmonary edema in the setting of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction when the patient is in a decompensated state. If the patient has a reduced ejection fraction and requires rate control, then digoxin is a highly effective medication that blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should immediately be cardioverted.\n\nMoskowitz et. al review the management of atrial fibrillation. They note that in the management of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, metoprolol is commonly used in the intensive care setting, is more successful than amiodarone, and had better rate control when compared to diltiazem.\n\nEhle et. al note that digoxin is approved to control ventricular response in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and is the only oral agent with positive inotropic effects approved for the management of mild to moderate heart failure.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG demonstrating an irregularly irregular rate/rhythm (note the spacing of the blue arrows indicating the QRS complexes) without P waves, which is suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Figure B is a chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral, hazy interstitial infiltrates, which are concerning for pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Albuterol and prednisone would be appropriate management of a COPD flare, which presents in a patient with a history of smoking with dyspnea, wheezing, increased work of breathing, and a barrel chest. While this patient\u2019s wheezing may be secondary to his COPD, it is much more likely to be a cardiac wheeze given his chest radiograph findings including pulmonary edema. Treating his atrial fibrillation is more likely to alleviate his pulmonary symptoms. Other treatments in COPD include ipratropium and BiPAP.\n\nAnswer C: Diltiazem would be an appropriate rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, particularly in the setting of a COPD flare as it will not impair the mechanism of albuterol (which should be given as a nebulizer in COPD flares). In this patient, further impairing cardiac contractility with a calcium channel blocker may worsen his underlying pulmonary edema (given his reduced ejection fraction).\n\nAnswer D: Intubation would be indicated if this patient\u2019s respiratory status were worsening, including failure to oxygenate, failure to ventilate, or impending respiratory failure. This patient\u2019s respiratory status has improved on BiPAP; thus intubation is not needed.\n\nAnswer E: Metoprolol, like diltiazem, would reduce cardiac contractility and may worsen pulmonary edema, in particular, in a patient with a reduced ejection fraction. It also may cause COPD symptoms to emerge, as beta-2 blockade may cause bronchoconstriction (even though metoprolol is beta-1 selective). It would be indicated as outpatient rate control for a patient with atrial fibrillation who can tolerate a beta-blocker, and is preferred in patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome, as it reduces mortality.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPatients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response with a reduced ejection fraction may be optimally managed with digoxin, which blocks the AV node and increases cardiac contractility.", "realidx": 104, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a 66-year-old man with a history of several medical conditions who presents with acute shortness of breath.

An appropriate maternal HIV treatment regimen is abacavir, lamivudine, and raltegravir; prophylaxis in the infant consists of zidovudine alone if maternal HIV viral load is suppressed to < 50 copies/mL.\n\nAll pregnant women should be screened for HIV as early as possible during pregnancy. Maternal treatment for HIV should be initiated as early as possible (before pregnancy if possible) with highly-active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as abacavir/lamivudine, plus an integrase inhibitor (e.g., raltegravir) or a protease inhibitor (e.g., ritonavir/atazanavir). Regimens for prophylaxis in infants of HIV-positive mothers depends on the HIV viral load at the time of delivery. If the viral load is < 50 copies/mL, infant prophylaxis with zidovudine alone for 4 weeks is sufficient. If the viral load is \u2265 50 copies/mL or the mother did not receive HAART during pregnancy, infant prophylaxis should consist of the 3-drug regimen of: zidovudine, lamivudine, and either nevirapine or raltegravir for 6 weeks.\n\nHarris et al. reviewed the treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy.

This leads to an increase in the mass of the left ventricle. There are many possible criteria on ECG for left ventricular hypertrophy including left axis deviation, large R waves, a large S wave in aVR, or ST segment depression and T wave inversion in the left heart leads (referred to as left ventricular strain). A more simple method of recalling left ventricular hypertrophy is very large voltages in the ECG leads that serve the left ventricle.

This suggests compartment syndrome in the setting of a tibial plateau fracture.\n\nTibial plateau fractures occur as a result of an axial load, where the femur forcefully impacts the tibia, leading to intense pain in the proximal tibia region. One potential complication of this type of fracture is compartment syndrome, which presents with exquisite pain out of proportion to exam with passive motion of the lower extremity. While radiography can aid in diagnosing tibial plateau fractures, a negative radiograph should prompt further investigation with a CT scan in patients with a high suspicion of this type of fracture. Treatment involves performing a fasciotomy if compartment syndrome is present. Surgical repair is warranted if there is evidence of neurovascular compromise or a significantly displaced fracture. Otherwise, immobilizing the knee and providing outpatient orthopedic follow-up care is deemed appropriate for certain less severe fractures.\n\nSchneiderman et al. studied compartment syndrome in high-energy tibial plateau fractures. The authors found that younger patients aged 12-29 years old are more likely to develop compartment syndrome, likely due to increased muscle mass and thicker fascial tissue. The risk of deep surgical site infection remains high at 20-25% of cases.

Malignancies that can cause virilization in or outside of pregnancy include Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors and Krukenberg tumors.\n\nAnswer C: Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling to determine prognosis may be performed in women who have early virilization and female fetuses. High androgen levels in the umbilical cord are required for the virilization of the fetus, whereas high androgen levels in the mother\u2019s peripheral blood may not predict this outcome.\n\nAnswer E: Spironolactone to treat hirsutism and acne is used outside of pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

{"question": "A 32-year-old G1P0 woman delivers a boy at 40 weeks and 3 days of gestation. The delivery is uncomplicated and the neonate has Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. After 15 minutes, he attempts to nurse for the 1st time. His mother notices that his face, chest, and extremities turn dusky blue during nursing. She also notes that he seems to be snoring loudly and breathing very quickly. When she removes him from her breast, he begins to cry and his color improves. The neonate\u2019s prenatal course was unremarkable, and his mother has a medical history of asthma with occasional albuterol inhaler use. As the infant is resting, vital signs are taken. His temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 45/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. A physical exam demonstrates well-perfused skin but is notable for the facial features shown in Figure A. Which of the following is most likely to be observed in this neonate?", "answer": "Inability to pass a nasogastric tube", "options": {"A": "Areflexia in all extremities", "B": "Digital clubbing", "C": "Inability to pass a nasogastric tube", "D": "Markedly decreased lung volume", "E": "Patent foramen ovale"}, "answer_idx": "C", "reason": "This neonate presents with central cyanosis upon feeding, resolution with crying, and midface hypoplasia on exam, most consistent with choanal atresia. A nasogastric (NG) tube would not pass through the nasal canal.\n\nChoanal atresia is caused by failed recanalization of the nasal fossae during fetal development. This disease typically presents with noisy breathing, cyanosis when feeding, and improvement with crying and the use of the mouth for breathing. Cyanosis in this condition affects the entire body as opposed to just the hands and feet. Bilateral atresia often presents early in life. Clinical suspicion of choanal atresia should prompt an attempt to pass an NG tube, which will meet resistance at the posterior part of the nasal canal. Treatment is with the surgical creation of the nasal passages.\n\nLesciotto et al. review the diagnosis and pathophysiology of patients with choanal atresia. They discuss how this condition is often comorbid with craniosynostosis. They recommend a better understanding of how these patients develop decreased nasal airway volume.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is a clinical photograph showing midface hypoplasia with a poorly developed nasal bone (red circle). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of choanal atresia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Areflexia in all extremities may be seen in spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition that causes loss of motor neurons. This condition may cause difficulty feeding due to weakness of the oropharyngeal and glossopharyngeal muscles, but it typically does not cause cyanosis. Treatment is with steroid use and nusinersen.\n\nAnswer B: Digital clubbing can result from chronic hypoxemia, as seen in conditions such as cystic fibrosis. It would be unexpected for a neonate to have clubbing as the characteristic finger appearance depends on the long-term deposition of platelet-derived growth factor and would not develop within minutes. This patient also does not have cyanosis at baseline. Treatment of cystic fibrosis is with enzyme repletion and respiratory therapy.\n\nAnswer D: Markedly decreased lung volume can occur in congenital diaphragmatic hernia, in which the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity and cause pulmonary hypoplasia. Infants may present with cyanosis due to respiratory failure, but there would be no association with feeding or improvement with crying. Vital signs would also be abnormal. Treatment is with surgical repair of the diaphragm.\n\nAnswer E: A patent foramen ovale occurs when the connection between the left and right atria does not close soon after birth. It does not result in cyanosis and is typically asymptomatic, though it may cause paradoxical embolism and stroke later in life. Treatment of a symptomatic patent foramen ovale is surgical closure of the defect.\n\nBullet Summary:\nChoanal atresia presents with cyanosis and respiratory distress that worsens with feeding and improves with crying associated with failure to pass a nasogastric tube.", "realidx": 120, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a neonate with specific symptoms and asks which observation is most likely in this neonate.

On ECG, there is progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until a P wave is not followed by a QRS complex (a dropped beat); then, the PR interval resets. Patients are typically asymptomatic, but should undergo evaluation for an underlying etiology of the dysrhythmia, such as electrolyte imbalances, medication side effect, or structural heart disease, as well as a follow-up ECG to evaluate for any progression. If the dysrhythmia is caused by medication, the offending agent should be discontinued, but otherwise there are no specific treatments necessary for asymptomatic patients. Patients who are symptomatic and hemodynamically stable can undergo telemetry monitoring and receive atropine with limited efficacy. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable and not responsive to atropine may need cardiac pacing. Generally, there is a low risk of progression to third degree AV block, and a pacemaker is rarely required (in contrast to second degree heart block type II).\n\nBarold and Hayes review second-degree heart block. They note the changes in AV node conduction time on ECG in this condition. They recommend using the correct definition of the different heart blocks for the correct underlying treatment.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG showing PR intervals that gradually prolong until a P wave is seen not followed by a QRS complex (note the blue bars that show the progressive lengthening of the PR intervals until the dropped beat).\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: First degree AV block is seen on ECG with prolonged PR intervals greater than 0.2 sec, but a consistent 1:1 ratio of P waves to QRS complexes. This finding is typically found in younger patients with increased vagal tone or in athletes, and does not require treatment.\n\nAnswer C: Second degree AV block, Mobitz type II is seen with fixed PR intervals and occasional dropped QRS complexes. Patients with Mobitz II sometimes present with syncope and frequently progress to third degree AV block. This finding may be associated with fibrotic changes to the conduction system or from acute, subacute, or prior myocardial infarction, and should be treated with placement of a pacemaker in most cases.\n\nAnswer D: Sinus bradycardia findings on ECG include normal sinus rhythm with a ventricular rate of less than 60 beats per minute. Patients with sinus bradycardia may be asymptomatic, but may also present with syncope, lightheadedness, chest pain, or hypotension. No treatment is required if the patient is asymptomatic, but atropine may be given to increase the heart rate in symptomatic cases. Pacemaker placement is required for patients with chronic symptoms.\n\nAnswer E: Third-degree AV block occurs when the atria and ventricles depolarize independently on ECG. There is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes. Patients may present with syncope, dizziness, acute heart failure, or hypotension.

Risk factors for developing a keratoacanthoma include immunosuppression, arsenic exposure, old scars or burns, xeroderma pigmentosum, or exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation. Most keratoacanthomas tend to involute within several months after initial onset; however, surgical excision can be performed because of the histologic similarity to squamous cell carcinoma.

These insults lead to worsening cognitive abilities and presents classically as a stepwise decline (sudden/sharp declines in cognitive function that occur at distinct periods of time, not gradually) in cognitive function (thinking, planning, self-control, flexibility in thought). This is often associated with neurologic deficits as byproducts of these strokes. Unlike other forms of dementia, this presentation is step-wise.

Patients classically present with chest pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis. Atypical manifestations of an acute myocardial infarction may include abdominal pain, nausea, reflux symptoms, and dizziness. The most important initial step in management is to administer aspirin as it lowers mortality and carries minimal risk. An ECG should then be performed. Classically, an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will demonstrate ST elevations in a vascular distribution. However, the progression to a STEMI is usually stepwise and may present with ST depressions, hyperacute T waves, pseudonormalization of the ST segment (a normal ST segment after a depression as it elevates), ST elevations, and finally tombstoning (a concave down wave that looks like a tombstone). If a STEMI is suspected after an ECG is performed, the patient should be started on a second antiplatelet agent (e.g., ticagrelor), heparin, and sent immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.\n\nNable et al. review the typical electrophysiologic changes found in STEMI.

Immediate management of hyperkalemia with ECG changes should include calcium administration followed by drugs that shift potassium intracellularly such as insulin, albuterol, or sodium bicarbonate. Further management may include diuresis and/or dialysis.\n\nAnswer B: Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy may demonstrate increased voltages throughout the ECG, in particular, in leads V2-V6 with deep Q waves in the septal leads. It may present with syncope upon exertion in a young patient (and in rare cases, sudden cardiac death). Ultrasound would show hypertrophy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Management involves staying hydrated, avoiding strenuous activities, and beta blockers.\n\nAnswer C: Hypokalemia can present initially on ECG with U waves and may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias.

Every P wave is followed by a narrow QRS complex, which is consistent with normal sinus rhythm.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Costochondritis presents with pain of the chest wall that can be sharp, aching, or pressure-like and typically worsens with cough or deep breathing. It is typically caused by injury to the chest, physical strain, or can be associated with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. On exam, the pain can be reproduced with palpation of the chest wall, in particular, the costochondral junction. This patient's chest pain is associated with exertion and relieved with rest, and his pain is not reproduced upon palpation of the chest wall. Thus, he is unlikely to have costochondritis.\n\nAnswer B: Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction presents similarly to unstable angina with substernal chest pain that is new-onset, accelerating, or occurring at rest, without ST elevations on ECG. However, ST depressions or T wave inversions may be present on ECG, and troponin I and creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) would be elevated, indicating myocardial injury.\n\nAnswer C: ST-elevation myocardial infarction presents with acute onset substernal chest pain that can radiate to the neck, arm, shoulders, or jaw and is sometimes associated with diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or anxiety. ECG shows ST elevations in a vascular distribution, and troponin I and CK-MB levels are elevated. This patient's ECG does not show ST elevations, and his symptoms are more consistent with stable angina.\n\nAnswer E: Unstable angina is characterized by substernal chest pain occurring at rest or occurring with more severity, longer duration, or increasing frequency. ECG may be normal or show ST depression or T wave inversion, and the troponin level is not elevated. It is caused by incomplete coronary artery occlusion by a thrombus or atherosclerosis, commonly due to a ruptured plaque with subsequent clot formation. This patient's chest pain is exertional, does not occur at rest, and is consistently relieved with rest, and thus would be consistent with stable angina.\n\nBullet Summary:\nStable angina is characterized by exertional chest pain that is not changing in quality or quantity and is relieved with rest.", "realidx": 149, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a 72-year-old man with chest pain related to physical activity, which resolves with rest.

{"question": "A 4-year-old boy is brought in by his grandmother for worsening seizure activity. She reports that occasionally he \u201csuddenly drops\u201d when running around the house. She says that his first seizure occurred 1 year ago. Since then, he has been on valproic acid but the seizure activity remains unchanged. He was recently enrolled in daycare because she could no longer care for him full-time. Since then, the seizure activity has increased and the daycare facility also noted concerns over his lack of response to voice commands. Family history is significant for a cousin who died suddenly at a young age. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/52 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 25/min.

The most appropriate next step in management is to replete potassium and magnesium and then start a beta-blocker.\n\nJervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defective potassium ion channels. This causes abnormal function of the inner ear resulting in congenital sensorineural deafness as well as abnormal myocardial conduction resulting in long QT syndrome. A prolonged QT interval increases the risk of ventricular dysrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, which may manifest as syncope, or sudden death. These episodes are usually triggered by exertion or by being startled. Management of symptomatic congenital long QT syndromes or torsades de pointes should involve the repletion of potassium and magnesium as well as the initiation of a beta-blocker medication. If symptoms are refractory to beta-blockers, a pacemaker can be implanted to avoid cardiac arrest.\n\nAdam et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. They discuss how a beta blocker medication should be used for medical control of this syndrome.

Beta-blocker medications should be used prior to pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: While potassium and magnesium should be repleted, procainamide is a class 1A anti-arrhythmic medication that prolongs the QT interval. This class of medication is contraindicated in patients with long QT syndrome or torsades de pointes.\n\nAnswer E: Ethosuximide is used to treat absence seizures. The loss of consciousness associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome can be mistaken for absence seizures, but the patient's prolonged QT interval on ECG makes Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome the most likely diagnosis.

Subsequently, this asplenic patient will require vaccination against encapsulated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae.\n\nThe capsules of encapsulated bacteria serve as an antiphagocytic virulence factor. To clear these bacteria, opsonization and subsequent clearance by the spleen must occur.

Arsenic inhibits enzymes requiring lipoic acid as a cofactor; thus, it disrupts ATP production and causes oxidative stress. Signs and symptoms of arsenic poisoning include Mees lines (white horizontal/parallel lines on the nail beds), nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, hypotension, tachycardia, and a garlic odor on the breath. Severe complications are more common with acute exposures and can include shock, pulmonary edema, rhabdomyolysis, and death. Findings consistent with chronic poisoning include anemia, neuropathy, ataxia, and somnolence. A urine arsenic level can support the diagnosis.

Episodes of painless hematuria are commonly seen in these patients.\n\nSickle cell trait is a condition that refers to carrying 1 normal and 1 abnormal beta-globin allele. On electrophoresis, this will present as 3 different bands consisting of about 50-60% HbA, 35-45% HbS, and < 2% HbF (fetal hemoglobin). HbF decreases significantly after the first 6 weeks of life. Individuals with sickle cell trait tend to be asymptomatic and do not have a decreased lifespan compared to the general population. However, they are at higher risk of some conditions. Patients are at increased risk of rhabdomyolysis during strenuous physical activity and may have episodic painless hematuria due to renal papillary necrosis. The hyperosmolar, acidotic, and hypoxic environment of the renal medulla is thought to trigger red cell sickling which results in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. Patients with sickle cell trait are managed similarly to the general population. These patients should receive reproductive counseling and use appropriate preventive measures to prevent dehydration during intensive exercise.\n\nHulsizer et al. studied the association between sickle cell trait and common medical conditions using insurance claims data.

Sickle cell trait is not clearly associated with an increased risk of infection and actually confers some protection against malaria.\n\nAnswer D: Splenectomy from auto-infarction is often seen in sickle cell anemia, but it is rare with sickle cell trait. In sickle cell anemia, splenic sequestration of sickled red blood cells causes infarction, leading to progressive atrophy and functional hyposplenism.

For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and electrocardiogram changes, the most appropriate next step in management is treatment with calcium gluconate\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when muscle cells lyse and release their intracellular contents. This can occur secondary to intense athletics, seizures, stimulant drug use, or a prolonged period of immobility. Lysis of muscle cells leads to release of potassium, myoglobin, purines, and other intracellular contents. Release of large amounts of myoglobin can result in renal impairment and myoglobinuria. On dipstick urinalysis, myoglobin causes a positive result for blood. Renal impairment further increases the risk for development of hyperkalemia. On ECG, hyperkalemia manifests with a \"peaked\" appearance of T waves, especially in the precordial leads. As hyperkalemia worsens, electrocardiogram changes progress to loss of P waves, QRS complex widening, and eventual sine wave rhythm. For patients with suspected hyperkalemia and characteristic changes noted on the electrocardiogram, the most appropriate immediate step in management is treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate.

However, she has persistent symptoms (diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, nontender goiter) despite maximum doses of these medications, which should then be treated with surgical thyroidectomy which can be performed safely in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy.\n\nGraves disease is caused by TSH receptor antibodies that activate the TSH receptor to synthesize thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism with suppressed TSH levels. The initial treatment for Graves disease is symptom control with a beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with a thionamide (e.g., propylthiouracil or methimazole). In the 1st trimester of pregnancy, propylthiouracil is preferred to methimazole. In the 2nd and 3rd trimesters, methimazole is the preferred thionamide. The treatment of choice in pregnancy for Graves disease that is refractory to propranolol and a thionamide is thyroidectomy, which can safely be performed in the 2nd trimester. This is reserved only for more severe cases refractory to medical treatment. In nonpregnant patients, radioiodine ablation is the preferred treatment for refractory Graves disease but is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of ablating the fetal thyroid.\n\nDavies et al. reviewed the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of Graves disease.

These medications include beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, other antiplatelet agents (clopidogrel), and ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors can reduce mortality after myocardial infarction by reducing afterload, allowing the damaged myocardium to maintain its ejection fraction. These medications also inhibit ventricular remodeling in this disease. ACE inhibitors most prominently reduce mortality if a patient's ejection fraction is reduced. Of note, ACE inhibitors also reduce mortality in diabetes by decreasing hyperfiltration damage to the glomeruli.\n\nJering et al. hypothesized that using an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor would improve mortality in patients who have sustained a myocardial infarction.

Because the patient is symptomatic from his dysrhythmia and it did not respond to atropine, the most appropriate next step is transvenous pacing.\n\nMobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block can be distinguished from Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) by the length of the PR interval. Whereas the PR interval in Mobitz type 1 becomes progressively longer with each beat, the PR intervals in Mobitz type 2 are consistent in length and the QRS complexes drop suddenly. While Mobitz type 1 heart block is usually caused by atrioventricular (AV) node dysfunction, Mobitz type 2 is caused by dysfunction below the AV node in the His-Purkinje system. Patients with either type of heart block can present with lightheadedness or syncope. Since this pattern has a risk of progressing into 3rd-degree heart block, hemodynamic compromise, and asystole, Mobitz type 2 heart block is an indication for placement of a permanent pacemaker.

Of the answer choices, only patching the sound eye (right eye) is an appropriate treatment.\n\nStrabismus occurs when a patient's eyes are not aligned properly. It often presents in children with one or both eyes turning inward, outward, upward, or downward. Patients will often tilt their heads or squint their eyes to correct this misalignment. Without proper treatment, there is a significant risk of developing amblyopia. Amblyopia is a developmental disorder in the visual cortex caused by abnormal visual stimuli. Untreated strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia; it is secondary to visual loss from the deviated eye. The treatment of choice is wearing an eye patch over the appropriately tracking eye (sound eye), thereby encouraging the use of the deviated eye and preventing vision loss in this eye. Other treatments include surgical correction of strabismus, pharmacological penalization of the sound eye with atropine, and dichoptic movies and video games.\n\nGopal et al. discuss the pathophysiology, prevention, and therapy for amblyopia as it relates to strabismus.

Frostbite can lead to rhabdomyolysis, which may cause hyperkalemia (causing ECG changes including peaked T waves and QRS widening as seen in this patient) and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte finding in frostbite).\n\nFrostbite occurs when there is an extensive freezing injury to tissues and can cause benign swelling, erythema, and pain, all the way to insensate extremities with necrosis and permanent dysfunction. More severe forms of frostbite can cause rhabdomyolysis or breakdown of the muscles. Breakdown of the muscle cells leads to leakage of the intracellular contents. Common electrolyte derangements include hyperkalemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement in rhabdomyolysis. It occurs due to the deposition of calcium in the necrotic muscle cells and the sequestration of calcium in the exposed sarcoplasmic reticulum. Note that hypocalcemia requires no treatment unless it is causing symptoms or ECG changes (such as QT prolongation). The management of rhabdomyolysis is centered on fluid administration to protect the kidney from myoglobin which is released from damaged muscles and is nephrotoxic.\n\nZimmerman and Shen review rhabdomyolysis.

Common causative agents include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. The latter of which is associated with the purpuric rash seen in this patient. The best initial step in management is a lumbar puncture followed promptly by IV broad spectrum antibiotics. Once the diagnosis/infectious agent is confirmed, the antibiotic agents can be refined.

His past medical history is notable for diabetes and obesity. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 30 years.

This patient initially has ST depressions (in triage) followed by ST segment normalization and possibly hyperacute T waves which raises concern for an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requiring frequent ECGs to determine if a STEMI evolves.\n\nA STEMI presents with crushing substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, chest pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain among many other possible presentations. When a patient presents with symptoms concerning for a STEMI, aspirin should be administered and an ECG should be performed. Early in a myocardial infarction, ST depressions with hyperacute T waves may be present. As the infarction evolves, the T waves may become more acute and the ST segment will begin to elevate. There may be a brief period of pseudonormalization where the ST segment appears to be normal. If the patient appears better, this can be reassuring. However, ongoing chest pain in the setting of these findings raises concern for pseudonormalization of the ST segment (an ST segment that is going to continue to rise). Nitroglycerin can be administered to see if the patient can become chest pain-free, and serial ECGs should be performed to determine if a STEMI is present. If symptoms resolve and the ECG is stable, this is reassuring and medical optimization and an elective catheterization may be performed. If the ECG evolves into a STEMI, then cardiac catheterization is indicated emergently.\n\nDaga et al. discuss STEMI and its workup. They note the ECG manifestations, and the pathophysiology in addition to the appropriate workup of acute coronary syndrome.

Repeating the ECG will allow for triaging of the patient and will aid in determining if emergency cardiac catheterization is needed.\n\nAnswer B: Chest radiography is appropriate in the workup of chest pain as it can rule out diagnoses such as pneumothorax or may suggest diagnoses such as an aortic dissection (type A) if there is a widened mediastinum. In this patient, the ST segment changes and characteristic history make acute coronary syndrome a more likely diagnosis, and while a chest radiograph should be performed at some point, repeating the ECG is a more dire initial step in management.\n\nAnswer C: CK-MB level could be helpful in determining if a myocardial infarction has occurred as it elevates rapidly and also decreases fairly rapidly. This makes it useful when diagnosing a new myocardial infarction after a recent infarction as the troponin may still be elevated from the previous infarction. This patient has no history of recent myocardial infarction, and a repeat ECG is more dire to determine if this patient needs emergent intervention. Of note, the decision for emergent catheterization should not wait on cardiac biomarkers.\n\nAnswer D: Heparin should not be given empirically to patients in chest pain. It does not necessarily decrease mortality but does increase the risk of bleeding. It is often given to patients with an NSTEMI.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPseudonormalization occurs when an ST depression begins to elevate and appears normal in the setting of a myocardial infarction, requiring close monitoring and serial ECGs to ensure that a ST elevation myocardial infarction does not occur.", "realidx": 197, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a 55-year-old man with symptoms suggestive of a cardiac event.

Findings of malrotation on an upper gastrointestinal series include an abnormally placed ligament of Treitz on the right side of the abdomen and a \"corkscrew\" appearance of the distal duodenum.

First-line primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation involves long term anticoagulation with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as rivaroxaban.\n\nAtrial fibrillation is caused by uncoordinated atrial contractions, typically due to atrial enlargement, inflammation, or infiltrative disease. Atrial fibrillation can lead to the formation of a thrombus, typically in the left atrial appendage, which can embolize to the brain and lead to an ischemic stroke. For this reason, there is a low threshold to start patients on long term anticoagulation for both primary and secondary stroke prevention (risk stratification is done with the CHA2DS2-VASc score, which considers several cardiovascular risk factors, age, sex, and diabetes). First-line long term anticoagulation is a DOAC medication such as apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban. Delayed initiation of anticoagulation is recommended at 4-14 days after a stroke, due to the interim risk of hemorrhagic conversion. Further management of atrial fibrillation includes a rate control agent such as a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker.\n\nJS Alpert reviews the latest American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines regarding atrial fibrillation. The article reports that for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, DOACs are first-line compared to warfarin due to a decreased risk for bleeding with DOACs. In patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis or a mechanical heart valve, warfarin is the preferred agent.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows an ECG with an irregularly irregular rhythm (highlighted by the spacing of blue arrows) and no discernable P waves before QRS complexes, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aspirin exerts antiplatelet adhesion effects through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Patients with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score of < 1) can use aspirin monotherapy for stroke prophylaxis. This patient presented after a stroke and will require long term anticoagulation, not anti-platelet monotherapy for stroke prevention.\n\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which works to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and increase HDL cholesterol. It is most useful in secondary stroke prevention in patients who have suffered a thrombotic or thromboembolic stroke secondary to atherosclerosis. This patient may have atherosclerosis and could benefit from statin therapy; however, anticoagulation for his underlying atrial fibrillation is the highest priority.\n\nAnswer C: A cardiac pacemaker is indicated in a large variety of cardiac conditions that primarily involve sinus node dysfunction or high-grade atrioventricular block. Atrial fibrillation does not typically require a pacemaker, as it is typically managed with rate control agents such as beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, or with electrical cardioversion. Rate control will not lower the stroke risk, and thus long-term anticoagulation is required.\n\nAnswer E: Warfarin has historically been a mainstay anticoagulant for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. DOACs are non-inferior to warfarin, and have a lower risk of bleeding. Note, only the initiation of warfarin requires a heparin bridge to mitigate the transient protein C deficiency that results in a temporary hypercoagulable state (often presenting as warfarin skin necrosis).\n\nBullet Summary:\nFor patients who present with an ischemic stroke secondary to a cardiac embolus from atrial fibrillation, first-line long term anticoagulation is a direct oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban).", "realidx": 207, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a 65-year-old man who presents with symptoms suggestive of a stroke.

Short QT syndrome is lethal and can lead to cardiac arrest in young, otherwise healthy patients.\n\nShort QT syndrome is an inherited condition that is caused by ion channel mutations (the most common identified mutation is a mutation in the cardiac myocyte potassium channel). There is no strict criteria for short QT syndrome, but the QT segment is often < 320 ms. Patients are usually young and healthy, and it is very common for the first presentation of this disease to be syncope or sudden cardiac death. ECG features suggestive of this condition include a short QT interval (without a clearly defined value but often < 360 ms) that is fixed (does not change with exercise or rest), peaked T waves, short or even absent ST segments, and episodes of atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation in a patient in whom this would not be expected (such as a young patient). The only effective intervention is the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\nBjerregaard and Gussak discuss short QT syndrome.

It may cause syncope but is not associated with short QT syndrome. Management involves the placement of a pacemaker.\n\nAnswer C: Torsades des pointes is associated with a prolonged QT segment that progresses to the classic twisting of the QRS complexes around an isoelectric baseline. It can lead to cardiac arrest and requires immediate cessation of QT-prolonging medications and administration of magnesium. Note that this patient\u2019s QT segment is short rather than long.\n\nAnswer D: Ventricular fibrillation presents with disorganized electrical activity with no discernible rhythm. While this patient may have arrested from ventricular fibrillation, the most likely underlying etiology for his cardiac arrest given his age, ECG, and risk factors is an underlying condition such as short QT syndrome. For this reason, short QT syndrome is a better answer.\n\nAnswer E: Ventricular tachycardia could also occur in short QT syndrome and may have caused this patient\u2019s cardiac arrest.

Toxic shock syndrome occurs most commonly due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) occurs due to infection with Staphylococcal or Streptococcal species that produce \"super-antigen\" toxins, such as TSST-1 produced by S. aureus. These toxins bind directly to the MHC-II receptor on T cells with high affinity causing a massive, sustained cytokine release. The result is a \"cytokine storm\" causing an intense inflammatory reaction and distributive shock. These infections arise in the setting of a retained tampon or retained nasal packing following nasal surgery; however, this is not always the case. The clinical presentation of TSS is characterized by fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and a diffuse \"sunburn-like\" rash. Desquamation of the palms and soles typically occurs during recovery, 1-2 weeks after the acute phase of the illness. The initial management of TSS begins with broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Typical regimens include vancomycin, cefepime, and clindamycin. The initial antibiotic regimen should cover methicillin-resistant Staph aureus. Clindamycin is always included due to its ability to suppress bacterial protein production, therefore limiting the production of bacterial toxins. Once a causative organism is identified, antibiotic therapy may be narrowed, though clindamycin is usually administered for the duration of treatment.\n\nFigure A is the classic generalized and erythematous macular/desquamating rash of toxic shock syndrome.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer A: Borrelia burgdorferi is a spirochetal bacteria that causes Lyme disease.

The most common explanation for a nonreactive NST is the fetal sleep cycle.\n\nPatients with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of fetal demise and other perinatal complications. They require closer monitoring during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The NST, which lasts 20 minutes, is the most common method of doing so. After 32 weeks, a reactive (i.e. \u201cnormal\u201d) NST requires at least 2 episodes of 15-beat-per-minute accelerations lasting for at least 15 seconds. An NST with no accelerations is considered nonreactive. A common cause of a nonreactive NST is the fetal sleep cycle and it is reasonable to continue the test for an additional 20 minutes to increase the chance of monitoring the fetus while awake. Otherwise, a nonreactive NST should prompt vibroacoustic stimulation or further testing such as a biophysical profile (BPP).\n\nUmana and Siccardi review the evidence regarding the use of the NST during pregnancy. They discuss how the test is a measurement of fetal cardiovascular function at the time of the test. They recommend monitoring the baseline fetal heart rate and variability as well as the presence of accelerations and decelerations when interpreting test results.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a representative portion of a NST where the fetal heart rate remains within a narrow band without accelerations (red circle). This pattern is characteristically seen in a nonreactive NST that can be due to the fetal sleep cycle.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Maternal dehydration generally should not affect the reactivity of an NST. Although severe dehydration may reduce amniotic fluid volume and therefore increase the baseline fetal pulse, it is unlikely to change the accelerations or variability in an NST. Though this patient had diarrhea the day before, her pulse is not elevated and any dehydration is probably not clinically significant.\n\nAnswer C: Maternal medication use can cause nonreactivity on an NST if drugs such as morphine or other sedatives are taken. Although this patient did take loperamide (an opioid), it is unlikely that this has a sedative effect on the fetus as it acts selectively on the mu-opioid receptors in the large intestine and does not cross the blood-brain barrier.\n\nAnswer D: Maternal smoking in close proximity to an NST has been linked to nonreactivity, but this patient has not smoked in several months. Mothers who smoke are counseled to avoid smoking on the day of their NST to avoid the effects of nicotine on their test results.\n\nAnswer E: A normal result is known as a reactive NST and would present with accelerations and no concerning or late decelerations.

Lewy body dementia is characterized histologically by Lewy bodies, which are intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions of alpha-synuclein (shown in Figure C).\n\nAlpha-synuclein is normally abundantly present in its unfolded form in neurons. Abnormal folding of alpha-synuclein leads to aggregation into insoluble fibrils. These intracytoplasmic aggregates (Lewy bodies) are seen in Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia, and multiple system atrophy, which are collectively referred to as alpha-synucleinopathies. Lewy body dementia is the second most common degenerative dementia and presents with fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism (bradykinesia, postural instability, rigidity, and a resting tremor), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disorder, autonomic dysfunction, and sensitivity to antipsychotics. Lewy body dementia can be distinguished from Parkinson disease with dementia by the timing of symptoms. In Lewy body dementia, cognitive symptoms begin at the same time as or 1 year prior to the onset of movement symptoms whereas in Parkinson disease the cognitive symptoms classically occur over 1 year after motor symptoms. There is no cure for Lewy body dementia, and treatment is aimed at alleviating symptoms.\n\nArnaoutoglou et al. reviewed the epidemiology, pathology, treatment, and future directions for research of Lewy body dementia. The authors found potential genetic bases for Lewy body dementia, including mutations in the GBA gene. They recommended that further research be conducted on the therapeutic implications of these genetic findings.\n\nFigure/Illustration A shows a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained brain biopsy of a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

A characteristic Pick cell (red box), or ballooned neuron, with dissolved chromatin (yellow arrow), is seen in this slide.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Figure A shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive dementia that manifests with poor concentration, declining executive function, startle myoclonus, 14-3-3 protein on lumbar puncture, and synchronous sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG). Clinical decline occurs over the course of weeks and months, culminating in death within a year. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease shows spongiform vacuolation due to the accumulation of abnormal prion protein (PrPsc).\n\nAnswer B: Figure B shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with a small lacunar infarct. Lacunar infarcts may be asymptomatic or cause focal neurologic deficits such as motor hemiparesis, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis, or dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome depending on the territory involved. Lacunar strokes will show diffuse eosinophilia of the affected area, followed by liquefactive necrosis with neutrophilic infiltration, followed by macrophages with surrounding reactive gliosis, finally leading to an area of tissue loss with residual gliosis.\n\nAnswer D: Figure D shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with Alzheimer disease. Alzheimer disease presents with a gradual cognitive decline with difficulty completing activities of daily living. Memory is the most prominently affected domain. Visual hallucinations, fluctuating levels of cognition, and extrapyramidal symptoms are not common in Alzheimer disease. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles may be seen on brain biopsy.\n\nAnswer E: Figure E shows an H&E stained brain biopsy of a patient with frontotemporal dementia (Pick disease). The behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia is associated with early-onset personality and behavioral changes, and it may be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. Unlike Lewy body dementia, memory is usually not affected in frontotemporal dementia until late in the disease course. frontotemporal dementia is characterized by Pick cells (ballooned neurons with dissolved chromatin) and Pick bodies, round intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.\n\nBullet Summary:\nLewy body dementia presents with alterations in consciousness, disorganized speech, visual hallucinations, extrapyramidal symptoms, early compromise of executive functions, and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions of alpha-synuclein (Lewy bodies) on biopsy.", "realidx": 235, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a 62-year-old woman with specific symptoms and medical history.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain CT angiography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAortic dissections develop due to a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta, causing a second blood-filled lumen to form. Risk factors include hypertension, trauma, Marfan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and pregnancy. Prognosis depends on the location and severity of the intimal tear. Aortic dissections are often described by using the Stanford classification, where Type A involves the ascending aorta and Type B involves tears distal to the left subclavian artery. Patients classically present with chest pain described as \"tearing\" or \"ripping\" with radiation into the back, arms, or abdomen. Hypertension is common. Chest radiography characteristically demonstrates widening of the mediastinum due to accumulation of blood between layers of the wall of the aorta. Type A dissections are managed with heart rate control, blood pressure control, and surgery. Type B dissections are managed with blood pressure and heart rate control only.\n\nCooper et al. report on aortic dissections in adolescence.

The most important initial step in management is a lateral canthotomy to alleviate retrobulbar pressure.\n\nA retrobulbar hematoma (or hemorrhage) occurs after blunt trauma to the eye. Presenting symptoms may include eye pain, photophobia, proptosis (an eye that appears to be anteriorly displaced), decreased visual acuity, and conjunctival injection. It is important to perform a thorough exam including a slit lamp exam and a fluorescein stain to rule out other traumatic injuries such as a globe rupture. Tonometry can be used to assess for increased intraocular pressure. A pressure > 20 mmHg suggests a diagnosis of orbital compartment syndrome, a vision-threatening condition. Immediate management with a lateral canthotomy is indicated in order to relieve pressure on the optic nerve and retina and save the patient\u2019s vision. Further management may require drainage of the hematoma in the operating room.\n\nBurkat et al. review the technique for performing a lateral canthotomy to relieve pressure in retrobulbar hematoma. The authors first excise the skin and orbicularis muscle at the lateral canthal angle in a horizontal direction for approximately 10 mm.

Extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn disease include fistula formation and erythema nodosum, which appear as multiple tender erythematous nodules that fade after 1-2 weeks into bluish plaques or macules that can be confused with bruises. Complications of Crohn disease when the disease involves the terminal ileum is vitamin deficiency and malabsorption. These deficiencies can include vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, zinc, and vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency presents with a macrocytic, megaloblastic anemia with hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear. Lab findings include elevated serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also associated with peripheral neuropathy and should be treated with intramuscular vitamin repletion.\n\nAkbulut presents the current state of evidence regarding vitamin deficiency in patients with Crohn disease.

SCD is a predisposing factor for avascular necrosis.\n\nAvascular necrosis has a multitude of direct causes, including irradiation, trauma (history of femoral neck fracture), hematologic diseases such as leukemia, SCD, and idiopathic etiology. In traumatic causes, injury to the medial femoral circumflex artery supplying the femoral head causes vascular disruption with resulting osteonecrosis. In SCD, the propensity for sickle-shaped erythrocytes to stick to one another and occlude blood vessels results in loss of circulation to the femoral head with consequent osteonecrosis. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head presents with insidious onset of anterior groin pain.

Common etiologies include idiopathic, post-viral, post-cardiac surgery, post-radiation, tuberculosis-related, or connective tissue disorder-related. It presents as right heart failure including symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain relieved by leaning forward, progressive peripheral edema, and ascites. A physical exam will identify an early diastolic pericardial knock, pericardial calcifications on chest radiograph, and jugular venous distension (JVD).

Hypotension and pulsus paradoxus (a greater than 10 mmHg decrease in the systolic blood pressure during inspiration), will commonly present in patients with cardiac tamponade. A chest radiograph will show an enlarged cardiac silhouette rather than calcifications in some cases. Treatment is with emergent pericardial decompression.\n\nAnswer B: Cirrhosis can present with ascites and peripheral edema, but will not have a marked elevation in jugular venous pressure. Cirrhosis is the end-stage result of many hepatic pathologies. Treatment is with the control of sequelae such as hepatic encephalopathy and venous congestion.\n\nAnswer D: Pulmonary arterial hypertension, like constrictive pericarditis, can present with exertional dyspnea, chest pain, and peripheral edema if it progresses to right ventricular failure. A chest radiograph may show enlarged central pulmonary arteries and peripheral pulmonary vessels. Treatment is with reduction of pulmonary pressure such as with endothelin inhibitors.\n\nAnswer E: Restrictive cardiomyopathy can also present as right heart failure with similar symptoms to constrictive pericarditis.

Given his poor CNS perfusion (somnolence during his tachycardia despite a \u201cnormal\u201d blood pressure), the most appropriate next step in management is cardioversion.\n\nWolff Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) is a pre-excitation syndrome where an accessory electrical pathway exists between the atria and ventricles that bypasses the AV node. WPW can demonstrate antidromic conduction where the accessory pathway leads to anterograde conduction causing a wide-complex tachycardia that is often mistaken for ventricular tachycardia. In this circumstance, the QRS is wide and a delta wave is often present but may be difficult to discern. If ever uncertain as to whether the diagnosis is ventricular tachycardia or WPW, cardioversion is a safe and effective intervention for both rhythms. Unstable patients with either WPW or ventricular tachycardia should undergo cardioversion immediately. Other treatments for WPW in stable patients may include procainamide.

Cerebral atrophy plays the earliest role in this presentation, resulting in exposure of the bridging veins and subsequent rupture with even minor trauma.\n\nChronic subdural hematomas present gradually, most often with headaches, somnolence, light-headedness, cognitive impairment, and rarely, seizures. Typically, the neurologic exam is largely normal but rarely focal deficits such as contralateral hemiparesis from compression of the cortex underlying the hematoma or ipsilateral hemiparesis from the lateral displacement of the opposite cortex may occur. Chronic SDH most often occurs in the setting of cerebral atrophy related to increased age, chronic alcohol use, and prior traumatic brain injury. Exposure of the bridging veins allows even minor trauma to precipitate subdural bleeding. A non-contrast CT of the head is indicated in any elderly patient with decreased mentation and concern for chronic SDH. Since old blood appears hypodense, imaging will allow for the determination of whether the bleed is acute or chronic. Supportive care is usually sufficient for treatment but surgical evacuation of the hematoma can be considered in patients with focal deficits or an expanding hematoma.\n\nMehta et al. review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of chronic subdural hematomas in elderly patients.

In children, abuse is an important cause of SDH, which may occur in the setting of \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d However, abuse is not especially associated with chronic SDH in the elderly population, and there is another plausible reason for this patient\u2019s presentation (trauma from a fall as evidenced by the resolving ecchymosis on his knee).\n\nAnswer D: Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, which typically presents with focal neurologic deficits such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or sensory loss. Although this patient does have a history of hypertension, he is normotensive in the emergency room and has non-focal neurologic decline that has been slowly progressive, which is less consistent with stroke. Furthermore, in contrast to this patient\u2019s CT scan, acute ischemic stroke would likely present with a normal head CT and prior infarct would cause a hypodensity in the parenchyma itself. Treatment is with risk factor optimization when a patient presents outside the window for thrombolytic agents.\n\nAnswer E: Increased CSF due to poor reabsorption by arachnoid granules is the cause of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Patients typically present with the \u201cwet, wacky, and wobbly\u201d triad \u2013 urinary incontinence, mental status changes, and magnetic gait.

Patients with Mobitz type 1 blocks generally do not require treatment unless symptomatic whereas those with Mobitz type 2 blocks generally require pacemaker placement.\n\nClark and Prystowsky review the pathophysiology of heart block. They discuss how a type 1 2nd-degree heart block is caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node. They recommend symptomatic treatment of this condition.\n\nFigure/Illustration A is an ECG that demonstrates the progressive prolongation of the PR interval (blue lines) until a beat is dropped. This progressive prolongation is characteristically seen in Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: A bundle branch block would produce a classic right or left bundle branch block pattern on ECG (RSR') described colloquially as \"bunny ears.\" Bundle branch blocks are defined in part by a QRS duration > 120 ms and can be seen in lead V1. Treatment is with control of underlying risk factors such as hypertension.\n\nAnswer C: The bundle of His conducts the electrical impulse from the atrioventricular node to the ventricles. Dysfunction at the level of the bundle of His would more likely cause Mobitz type 2 2nd-degree heart block or 3rd-degree heart block rather than the Mobitz type 1 heart block seen in this patient. Treatment is with pacemaker placement.\n\nAnswer D: Purkinje fibers rapidly conduct along the ventricular walls to create synchronized contraction of the ventricles. Aberrant conduction of the Purkinje fibers leads to premature ventricular complexes. Treatment is with beta-blockers if patients are symptomatic.\n\nAnswer E: The sinoatrial node is the heart\u2019s primary pacemaker. Dysfunction at this level can lead to sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome can manifest as many types of arrhythmias, including bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, in which there is alternating bradycardia with paroxysmal tachycardia. Sinoatrial node dysfunction can be treated with pacemaker placement.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) 2nd-degree heart block is characterized by progressive prolongation of the PR interval before a dropped QRS complex and is usually caused by dysfunction of the atrioventricular node.", "realidx": 293, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 68-year-old woman with symptoms of dizziness and an irregular heartbeat.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of polysubstance abuse is found down in his home acutely obtunded. Emergency medical services administered naloxone which immediately woke the patient up and improved his oxygen saturation from 40% to 90%. However, they noted subsequently that the patient demonstrated increased work of breathing and had crackles and wheezing on pulmonary exam. The patient arrives alert and oriented claiming he feels short of breath. He denies any chest pain or other symptoms aside from shortness of breath. He has a history of cocaine-induced cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction from cocaine use 2 years ago. The patient has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 96.0\u00b0F (35.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 26/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. Physical exam reveals increased work of breathing, pulmonary crackles, and wheezing. A chest radiograph is performed as seen in Figure A. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's current symptoms?", "answer": "Medication administration", "options": {"A": "Atypical pneumonia", "B": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "C": "Community acquired pneumonia", "D": "Medication administration", "E": "Poor cardiac function"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient is presenting after administration of naloxone with respiratory distress, wheezing, crackles, and pulmonary edema on chest radiography, suggesting acute pulmonary edema. Given the presence of symptoms immediately following naloxone administration, the cause of the pulmonary edema is likely the naloxone (medication-induced) that was administered.\n\nOpioid use disorder is a common problem in the United States and can lead to overdose, which is life-threatening if not treated. Patients with symptoms of opioid intoxication including miosis, bradypnea, and altered mental status should be empirically given naloxone, as it may be life-saving and is relatively benign. Naloxone should only be given for patients with unstable vitals or who are failing to ventilate/oxygenate or protect their airway. Naloxone commonly precipitates withdrawal and may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pain. It is possible for naloxone to cause pulmonary edema (via a poorly elucidated mechanism). Pulmonary edema presents with wheezing, tachypnea, and pulmonary crackles. The most important intervention when treating pulmonary edema is to address the underlying cause and start the patient on positive pressure ventilation. Diuretics may be administered if the patient is volume overloaded. An echogardiogram can rule out poor cardiac function as the underlying etiology as well.\n\nLassen et al. review naloxone use and pulmonary edema. They note that naloxone administration can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and that the mechanism is not well elucidated. They recommend that naloxone should only be used at the lowest dose possible to stabilize the patient.\n\nFigure A is a chest radiograph demonstrating \"fluffy\" interstitial infiltrates throughout both lung fields suggestive of pulmonary edema.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atypical pneumonia may present with a dry cough, fever, hypoxia, and increased interstitial markings on chest radiograph. These patients are usually well appearing, and the opacities are not as \"fluffy\" as pulmonary edema. A common cause is Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\nAnswer B: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents with a flattened diaphragm and increased number of visible ribs on chest radiography as a result of air accumulation in the chest. Pneumonia may be present on chest radiograph and is a common cause of COPD flares. A COPD flare may present with wheezing, poor air movement, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.\n\nAnswer C: Community-acquired pneumonia presents with a fever, cough, hypoxia, and a lobar consolidation on chest radiograph. This infiltrate is usually confined to one lobe and is thus often called \"lobar pneumonia.\" Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause.\n\nAnswer E: Poor cardiac function can cause pulmonary edema via increased hydrostatic pressure backing up into the lungs causing fluid leakage. Though the appearance of pulmonary edema would be the same, naloxone causes non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. In this patient with a previous myocardial infarction, a low ejection fraction may plausibly be contributing to this patient's pulmonary edema; however, the association of symptoms with naloxone administration makes this a less likely etiology for this case.\n\nBullet Summary:\nNaloxone can cause non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.", "realidx": 307, "cleanse_cot": "The problem describes a clinical scenario involving a patient with a history of polysubstance abuse who presents with respiratory symptoms.
