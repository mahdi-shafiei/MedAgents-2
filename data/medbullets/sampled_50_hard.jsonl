Her older brother has been diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but the rest of her family history is otherwise unremarkable. The patient has become more withdrawn lately and has sometimes been ignoring her parents when asked to perform tasks at home. This seems to have worsened over the last 8 weeks. Otherwise, the patient is energetic and started preschool 3 months ago. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 98/62 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 26/min. The patient successfully draws a square and can stand on 1 foot. Her language skills are unchanged from her appointment 6 months ago.

The patient should undergo audiometry testing.\n\nHearing impairment in children can be genetic or acquired. In a patient with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss is the most common underlying cause of hearing impairment. Hearing impairment can often present similarly to behavioral or persistent developmental disorders. In a child with poor language skills, social skills, and self-isolation, hearing loss should be ruled out first before considering other diagnoses. Undetected hearing loss can progress with poor academic performance, personal-social maladjustment, and emotional difficulties as children progress through critical development stages. The treatment for hearing loss is the restoration of hearing through hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other supportive measures.\n\nDammeyer et al. studied the impact of childhood hearing loss on family life. They found that children with additional disabilities were more likely to be ignored by parents. They recommend understanding family dynamics in order to better support patients and families.\n\nIncorrect Answers\nAnswer B: Autism spectrum screening questionnaire is useful in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in children presenting with social isolation and poor communication skills. Autism spectrum disorder often presents with repetitive behaviors and fixed interests, which are absent in this child. Hearing loss should be ruled out first before pursuing this diagnosis. Treatment of autism spectrum disorders is early intervention and counseling.\n\nAnswer C: Parent and teacher ADHD rating scales should be obtained to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While children with ADHD often appear inattentive and impulsive in multiple domains, poor language development, and social isolation are not features of ADHD. This patient should first undergo an audiometry test. ADHD can be treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate.\n\nAnswer D: Referral for genetic testing is an incorrect first step in the management of this patient. While delayed language can be seen with several genetic conditions, there are usually signs of other global motor, cognitive, and social delays. Additional genetic testing can be pursued if the patient\u2019s audiometry testing results are normal.\n\nAnswer E: Referral for speech and language assessment is an incorrect first step. A formal assessment should be obtained in the diagnosis of communication and language disorders. However, this should only be done after ruling out hearing loss.

Given his stability, the most appropriate next step is an abdominal and chest CT.\n\nIn blunt abdominal trauma, the next step in management depends upon whether the patient is hemodynamically stable. With a normal blood pressure and pulse within the normal range, patients can undergo imaging to evaluate for injury to the abdominal organs with the most appropriate study being an abdominal CT with contrast. This study can accurately localize bleeding and aid in operative planning. A bedside ultrasound known as the FAST exam is often performed in unstable patients. Unstable patients, patients with abdominal tenderness, and patients with a severe mechanism of trauma may have a bedside FAST exam performed. If the free fluid is localized, the patient can be transferred directly to the operating room. Note that in many hospitals, the FAST exam is done simultaneously with the primary and secondary survey; however, if asked to choose which exam to perform on a trauma patient who is stable with no signs of a surgical abdomen, a CT scan should be performed to more accurately assess the patient's injuries and assess for injuries that may be missed by a FAST exam.\n\nFeliciano reviewed the evidence surrounding the current diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma. He discusses how contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is an important method for evaluating the etiology of intra-abdominal bleeding. He recommends considering damage control methods in the polytrauma patient.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Chest radiography has limited utility in the setting of blunt abdominal trauma; however, a portable anterior-posterior film is often taken in trauma, in particular, when the patient is intoxicated. However, an anterior-posterior and lateral film would involve transporting the patient to radiology and positioning the patient. Thus it would be both difficult to obtain and less useful when compared to a CT scan given his traumatic injuries. Findings on chest radiograph could suggest abdominal injury, such as lower rib fractures or free air under the diaphragm, which would suggest intestinal perforation.\n\nAnswer C: Diagnostic laparoscopy may play a role in evaluating for injury in penetrating traumas such as gunshot wounds or stabbing wounds but would not be indicated as the most appropriate initial step in management in a stable patient. Unstable patients, surgical abdomens, and positive FAST exams or CT scans warrant transfer to the operating room.\n\nAnswer D: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a historical test to assess for intra-abdominal injury that was typically used with ambiguous FAST exams or patients where it was unclear whether there was abdominal bleeding; however, it has almost entirely been supplanted by the FAST exam.\n\nAnswer E: FAST exams are often performed with the primary or secondary survey in large institutions where resources are available. However, in small hospitals with limited resources, the most appropriate next step in management when deciding between a FAST exam or a CT scan should be made based on the mechanism and concern for bleeding.

Laboratory workup is performed, and the results are shown below: Serum: Hemoglobin: 7.2 g/dL Total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL Direct bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dL Lactate dehydrogenase: 470 U/L Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 7 U/gHb (normal: 6-20 U/gHb) Which of the following would most likely be seen on a peripheral blood smear in this patient?", "answer": "Degmacytes", "options": {"A": "Acanthocytes", "B": "Codocytes", "C": "Degmacytes", "D": "Schistocytes", "E": "Spherocytes"}, "answer_idx": "C", "reason": "This patient presents with hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, elevated indirect bilirubin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase) shortly after starting a sulfa medication (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) in the setting of likely glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Degmacytes (\"bite cells\") will be seen on peripheral blood smears in these patients.\n\nPatients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency will experience hemolytic anemia when exposed to an oxidizing substance such as sulfa drugs or fava beans. Laboratory tests will show a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Since hemolysis releases intracellular enzymes into the bloodstream, serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase will be increased. Hemoglobin is then metabolized in the spleen into unconjugated bilirubin, which will cause an elevated bilirubin level that is primarily indirect. In the acute setting, G6PD levels will be normal because the most compromised cells have all been hemolyzed. Obtaining a G6PD level in between episodes of hemolysis is therefore required to observe the chronically decreased G6PD in these patients. A peripheral blood smear will reveal degmacytes (\"bite cells\") and Heinz bodies. Avoidance of oxidative stress to red blood cells is the most important component of management in these patients.\n\nBelfield and Tichy discuss the classic presentation of G6PD deficiency in patients.

Patients with thalassemia will present with chronic anemia without acute episodes of hemolysis. The increased lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin levels in this patient indicate an acute hemolytic event.\n\nAnswer D: Schistocytes can be seen in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with TTP present with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, fever, neurologic symptoms, and acute kidney injury. DIC is a common downstream pathway for many processes such as sepsis, malignancy, and eclampsia; however, it would present with diffuse clotting and bleeding from all sites.\n\nAnswer E: Spherocytes can be seen in hereditary spherocytosis, which may result in hemolysis during times of acute stress; however, this patient denies symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

These findings suggest a diagnosis of hemophilia A caused by factor 8 deficiency.\n\nHemophilia is a deficiency of factor 8 (hemophilia A) or factor 9 (hemophilia B). Common symptoms of hemophilia include hemarthrosis, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding. Laboratory testing is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as hemophilia is characterized by an isolated prolongation of PTT without a change in PT. The factors involved in hemophilia participate only in the indirect cascade of coagulation factor activation. Similarly, since bleeding time depends only upon platelet function and not coagulation factors, hemophilia presents with a normal bleeding time. Treatment of hemophilia includes desmopressin in mild cases and factor replacement in moderate to severe disease.\n\nBerntorp et al. present a review of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hemophilia. They discuss how these patients now have normal life expectancies with the advent of factor replacement therapy. They recommend being vigilant for the development of anti-factor antibodies.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anti-platelet antibodies are responsible for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). This disease is caused by autoimmune antibody formation that damages platelets and causes them to be removed by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system. It usually occurs in children after an acute viral infection and it presents with bleeding from mucosal surfaces with laboratory findings showing an increased bleeding time, decreased platelets, and a normal PT/PTT.\n\nAnswer C: Factor 9 deficiency (hemophilia B) presents nearly identically to hemophilia A with a normal PT, prolonged PTT, and normal bleeding time with a history of bleeding in male relatives. However, because hemophilia B is epidemiologically less common than hemophilia A, hemophilia A is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer D: GP1b deficiency causes Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by unusually large platelets and a low platelet count. Like von Willebrand disease (vWD), patients often present with cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, abnormal bleeding from minor trauma, and a prolonged bleeding time, which this patient does not have. It can be distinguished from vWD by a ristocetin assay. Treatment can include tranexamic acid.\n\nAnswer E: Von Willebrand factor deficiency results in vWD, which is a bleeding disorder characterized by cutaneous and mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Unlike this patient, patients with vWD also present with a prolonged bleeding time. Patients with vWD will also have an increased PT because this factor is responsible for stabilizing coagulation factor 8.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHemophilia A is caused by factor 8 deficiency and presents with hemarthrosis, frequent bruising, intramuscular hematoma, and gastrointestinal bleeding with a prolonged PTT with a normal PT and bleeding time.", "realidx": 19, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory test results.

Patients with this disorder should avoid lactose-containing products by changing to a soy-based formula.\n\nClassic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. This enzyme is involved in the conversion of galactose to glucose, and a deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of galactose 1-phosphate in the liver, kidney, and brain. This metabolite acts as a phosphate sink, meaning that it traps all free phosphate in the cytosol and inhibits the formation of other phosphate-dependent metabolites such as adenosine triphosphate. This results in failure to thrive, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatosplenomegaly after ingestion of galactose-containing products such as milk.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer the antidote N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\n\nIn a toxicology case where the ingestion is unknown, the most appropriate initial step in management is to begin treatment empirically with IV fluids, charcoal, NAC, naloxone, and glucose if needed. These agents are effective against the most common causes of intoxication. In cases where there is known acetaminophen ingestion, the most important treatment is prompt administration of NAC. This medication works by increasing the hepatic production of glutathione, which detoxifies the toxic metabolite of acetaminophen N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAC is a safe, cheap, and effective treatment that could be life-saving if administered in a timely fashion. In massive overdoses, it is appropriate to start treatment empirically as it can be discontinued later. Otherwise, a 4 hour acetaminophen level should be collected and the level should be plotted on the Rumack Matthew nomogram to determine treatment. In chronic acetaminophen toxicity, the acute serum level play no role in guiding treatment.\n\nChiew et al. performed a meta-analysis regarding the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. They found that the administration of charcoal immediately after ingestion can decrease the rate of absorption of acetaminophen. They recommend early administration of N-acetyl cysteine in order to decrease the hepatotoxicity of this substance.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blood acetaminophen levels should be ordered, but it is much less dire to confirm the diagnosis than it is to begin treatment given the high fatality rate with untreated acetaminophen overdose. Testing for all common intoxication should proceed while treatment is being administered. In this case, the concern for consumption of an entire bottle of acetaminophen would make it reasonable to treat first.\n\nAnswer B: Charcoal is an appropriate intervention if it is given in a timely manner; however, this patient consumed acetaminophen over 2 hours ago.

{"question": "A 14-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for behavioral issues. At school, he interrupts class by making barking noises.

He does not appear to be reacting to internal stimuli. His mood and affect are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?", "answer": "Haloperidol", "options": {"A": "Clozapine", "B": "Dextroamphetamine", "C": "Fluoxetine", "D": "Haloperidol", "E": "Methylphenidate"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient presents with multiple motor tics (grimacing, eye blinking) and phonic tics (barking, throat-clearing) on a daily basis for more than 1 year, which are consistent with Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome can be medically treated with antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol.\n\nTourette syndrome presents with multiple motor tics (e.g., grimacing, sniffing) and 1 or more phonic tics (e.g., throat-clearing, barking) that occur for at least 1 year. Tics must begin before the age of 18 years, and their location, frequency, type, complexity, or severity must change over time. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are often co-morbid conditions. Common first-line treatments for Tourette syndrome-related tics include habit reversal training and alpha-2 agonists such as guanfacine or clonidine. However, the only pharmacologic treatments approved for Tourette syndrome in the United States are the antipsychotics haloperidol, pimozide, and aripiprazole. Risperidone is also used due to its favorable side effect profile.\n\nSeideman and Seideman review the current treatments for Tourette syndrome. They note it is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that often occurs in children and presents with motor and phonic tics. They recommend treating with both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for optimal care.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that blocks dopamine D2 receptors but is not approved for treatment of Tourette syndrome. It is typically avoided due to the risk for agranulocytosis and is mainly used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia as a last-line agent. Weight gain is another significant side-effect.\n\nAnswer B: Dextroamphetamine is a stimulant commonly used for the treatment of ADHD. ADHD can be comorbid with Tourette syndrome but presents with hyperactivity (e.g., fidgeting, difficulty taking turns, blurting out answers) and/or inattentive symptoms (e.g., daydreaming, difficulty completing tasks) in at least 2 settings. While this patient\u2019s phonic tics are disruptive, he has no difficulty waiting his turn and completing his chores, making Tourette syndrome more likely.\n\nAnswer C: Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may be used for the treatment of OCD. OCD is often co-morbid with Tourette syndrome but compulsions are present, which manifest as repetitive counting, hoarding, tapping, or error checking. This patient\u2019s behavior is better attributed to his tics rather than compulsions.\n\nAnswer E: Methylphenidate is a stimulant used for the treatment of ADHD.

The treatment of choice is alkali replacement (sodium bicarbonate).\n\nType 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis results from impaired acid (H+) secretion in the distal nephron. Impaired acid secretion decreases the kidney's ability to acidify the urine, thus increasing the urine pH. Impaired acid secretion also results in potassium wasting resulting in hypokalemia. Acidemia causes the bone to release calcium phosphate which buffers the acid. The alkaline urine along with decreased citrate excretion (caused by acidemia) leads to a favorable environment to form calcium phosphate stones. Therefore, correction of metabolic acidosis is essential in managing this condition.\n\nPalmer et al. review the evidence regarding the treatment of renal tubular acidosis. They discuss how this disease can be divided into types based on the location of the deficit. They recommend using alkali therapy in patients with distal renal tubular acidosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering hydrochlorothiazide would be a treatment option for type 2 (proximal) renal tubular acidosis. Patients with this condition can have associated hypokalemia but would be expected to have an acidic urine pH (less than 5.5) after significant bicarbonate excretion.\n\nAnswer B: Administering intravenous insulin would further decrease the serum potassium and place the patient at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia. This patient's most important concern is her renal tubular acidosis that is resulting in muscle weakness from hypokalemia. Her polyuria is caused by hypokalemia, as it decreases the kidney's responsiveness to antidiuretic hormone. Her serum glucose is also not significantly elevated to cause osmotic diuresis.\n\nAnswer D: The dextrose (in the replacement therapy with potassium) would trigger the pancreas to secrete insulin and would lead to an intracellular shift of potassium. This would not particularly improve extracellular potassium levels. Treatment should be aimed at addressing the root of the patient's symptoms. Potassium citrate can be administered in cases of severe hypokalemia and hypokalemia that persists after correcting the serum bicarbonate level.\n\nAnswer E: Increasing the methotrexate dose is not appropriate in this case.

This can lead to hyperlipidemia (due to loss of lipoproteins), hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III and protein C/S), and hypoalbuminemia. Most serum calcium is bound to albumin, so when albumin is lost in the urine, it can lead to profound hypocalcemia. The ionized or free portion of calcium remains the same; therefore, these patients do not exhibit symptoms of hypocalcemia.

The first step in the resuscitation of patients with variceal hemorrhage is rapid administration of intravenous (IV) fluids and octreotide.\n\nEsophageal and gastric varices, most commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis, are abnormally distended veins that are a product of venous congestion from portal hypertension. As these varices can project into the gastrointestinal lumen, they are subject to rupture either spontaneously or by mechanical disruption (e.g., tearing by food particles). Variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening complication of cirrhosis as it can quickly progress to hemorrhagic shock or airway loss (if profuse vomiting is present). Patients should immediately receive 2 large-bore peripheral IVs (or central IV access) with which to administer IV fluid boluses to increase circulating volume. Blood should be transfused as needed, and a massive transfusion protocol may be needed. Patients should also be given octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor, in an effort to divert blood away from the hemorrhaging varices. Other treatments that should be given include ceftriaxone (to reduce bacteremia and mortality), proton pump inhibitors, and possibly interventions such as tranexamic acid. Upper GI endoscopy and banding are the definitive therapy.\n\nStanley et al review the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding with initial IV fluid resuscitation as the first measure to achieve hemodynamic stability. They also report that for patients with cirrhosis, vasoactive drugs such as octreotide should be started as soon as variceal hemorrhage is suspected. Red blood cell transfusion is indicated at a hemoglobin transfusion of 7.0-8.0 g/dL. Definitive therapy is endoscopy with variceal ligation.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Balloon tamponade is often performed in the emergency department or intensive care unit as a temporizing measure to achieve hemostasis for patients with severe and persistent variceal hemorrhage. The balloon is inserted into the esophagus or stomach and inflated to apply direct pressure to the bleeding varices; this buys valuable time in the transition to definitive endoscopic management.\n\nAnswer B: Ceftriaxone is administered to patients with cirrhosis who present with an upper gastrointestinal bleed as a prophylactic measure against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This patient is hemodynamically unstable, and antibiotics should not delay initial intravenous fluid resuscitation as well as other measures to reduce and/or stop the bleeding. While this patient should receive ceftriaxone, it is more dire to first give fluids, blood, and octreotide.\n\nAnswer C: Nadolol or other nonselective beta-blocker therapy is indicated as secondary prophylaxis to prevent future bleeding episodes for patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage. Non-selective beta blockers such as nadolol decrease portal pressure, but are contraindicated in the acute setting as they could exacerbate hypovolemic shock by reducing cardiac output.\n\nAnswer D: Platelet transfusion is required for patients with variceal hemorrhage with an initial platelet count < 50,000/mm^3, and for those who receive a significant amount of blood products during their resuscitation (significant dilutional thrombocytopenia can occur after 10-12 units of transfused red blood cells). This patient's platelet count is above 50,000/mm^3, and he has not yet received blood products.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of a cirrhosis patient with acute variceal hemorrhage is the rapid administration of intravenous fluids and octreotide, a splanchnic vasoconstrictor.", "realidx": 58, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 52-year-old man with hematemesis and a history of alcohol use disorder.

Other symptoms that may be indicative of preeclampsia with severe features include headaches, visual changes, and abdominal pain. Other features consistent with preeclampsia include thrombocytopenia, kidney insufficiency, impaired liver function, and pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be supported when a pregnant patient is both hypertensive and demonstrates an elevated protein in her urine. It is possible for postpartum patients to experience preeclampsia. Though the fetus and placenta have been delivered, which is the definitive treatment of preeclampsia, further medical management is still needed.

It involves bleeding between the skin of the scalp and the galea aponeurosis. Unlike a cephalohematoma, caput succedaneum lesions may cross the suture lines of the cranial bones. Caput succedaneum is typically described as fluctuant and ecchymotic, and the swelling usually self-resolves within a few days.

The medial medulla is supplied by paramedian branches of the vertebral arteries and the anterior spinal artery.\n\nMedial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is usually caused by atherosclerotic occlusion of paramedian branches of the anterior spinal artery, vertebral arteries, or basilar artery which supply the medial medulla. Medial medullary structures include the lateral corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the hypoglossal nerve. Lesions to the lateral corticospinal tract lead to contralateral paresis of the upper and lower extremities. Lesions to the medial lemniscus lead to decreased vibration, proprioception, and light touch on the contralateral body. Ipsilateral hypoglossal nerve dysfunction leads to ipsilateral loss of function of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue including the genioglossus muscle, which protrudes the tongue forward from the root and is unopposed on the contralateral side. This pushes the tongue towards the side of the lesion, leading to ipsilateral tongue deviation. Treatment includes reperfusion via thrombolytics if the patient presents within 4.5 hours of the time last known well.\n\nKim and Han present clinical findings, radiographic findings, angiographic data, and long-term outcomes from a case series of 86 patients with medial medullary infarction. The authors found that old age and severe motor dysfunction at admission were predictive factors portending poor prognosis. The authors recommend close follow-up of these patients for the development of central post-stroke pain.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a lesion of the lateral pons, with damage to the facial nucleus, vestibular nuclei, spinothalamic tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, sympathetic fibers, labyrinthine artery, and middle and inferior cerebellar peduncles. This presents with complete facial hemiparesis, vomiting, decreased pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and ipsilateral face, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, and ipsilateral sensorineural deafness and vertigo.\n\nAnswer C: Lenticulostriate branches of the middle cerebral artery supply the internal capsule. Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. The findings of ipsilateral tongue deviation and sensory changes are not consistent with a lesion to the internal capsule.\n\nAnswer D: Pontine perforators of the basilar artery supply the medial pons. Strokes of the medial pons lead to quadriplegia and loss of facial, mouth, and tongue movements with preserved sensorium. This patient\u2019s findings of hemiparesis, ipsilateral tongue deviation, and changes in sensorium are more suggestive of a lesion to the medial medulla, not the medial pons.\n\nAnswer E: Posterior inferior cerebellar artery infarction leads to a stroke of the lateral medulla (Wallenberg syndrome).

Given the likely diagnosis of transient proteinuria, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon.\n\nTransient proteinuria can be due to febrile illnesses, seizures, strenuous exercise, emotional stress, serious illnesses like heart failure, and abdominal surgery. A detailed workup is not needed if the clinical story is clear, but an orthostatic test can be completed. One way to do this is to assess the urine dipstick in the morning and in the afternoon. Another way requires the patient to collect urine at multiple times throughout the day. A diagnosis is confirmed if the morning sample is protein-free but the evening sample contains protein. In general, pediatric patients with orthostatic proteinuria should have under 1 gram of protein in a full 24 hours. Treatment is with reassurance because this condition usually resolves by itself.\n\nIngold and Bhatt review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of orthostatic proteinuria in patients.

It would be more prudent to obtain basic labs and a timed urinalysis before exposing a pediatric patient to radiation.\n\nAnswer B: Renal biopsy is indicated if the patient's clinical presentation is concerning for a glomerular or tubulointerstitial etiology for proteinuria. Patients will have edema, hematuria, or dysuria.\n\nAnswer C: Repeat urinalysis will not change the presence of proteinuria. Generally, a patient who has proteinuria should have a repeat urinalysis performed to rule out transient proteinuria. If the repeat urinalysis demonstrates proteinuria (as in this patient), then the diagnosis is unlikely to be transient proteinuria, and further workup is needed.\n\nAnswer E: Urine electrolytes and creatinine will assess the kidney's ability to concentrate urine and assess the etiology of acute kidney injury.

Symptoms include bulbar muscle weakness and type 2 respiratory failure (inadequate alveolar ventilation). The most appropriate initial step in management is to maintain adequate respiratory function by intubation. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is used to remove acetylcholine receptor antibodies from circulation, and steroids are started for long-term therapy.

She denies any head trauma or loss of consciousness associated with the fall. She has a medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and hypothyroidism for which she takes escitalopram and levothyroxine. She had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 5 years ago.

Roux-en-y gastric bypass reduces parietal cell count, leading to reduced intrinsic factor secretion, which is needed for vitamin B12 absorption.\n\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass is a laparoscopic bariatric procedure that creates a small gastric pouch from the stomach with a gastrojejunal and jejunojejunal anastomosis. This causes small volumes of food to be consumed and decreases nutrient absorption. The small gastric pouch contains very few parietal cells, which decreases hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor secretion. The reduced intrinsic factor secretion impairs the protection of vitamin B12 against HCl and reduces absorption in the ileum. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neuropsychiatric changes (depressed mood, irritability, and insomnia) and subacute combined degeneration (weakness, sensory ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, and upper motor neuron signs). Patients who undergo Roux-en-Y gastric bypass must be given high doses of vitamin B12 (often intramuscularly) in order to prevent deficiency.\n\nAlexandrou et al. review long-term micronutrient deficiencies after sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).

{"question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was running a marathon but became confused halfway through the race. He arrives unable to coherently answer questions and is not sure where he is. He has a history of a seizure disorder.

Physical exam reveals a confused man who is moving all 4 extremities and is protecting his airway. During the exam, he develops a tonic-clonic seizure, which lasts 1 minute and then terminates on its own. The patient is given intravenous fluids, and basic laboratory studies are drawn and pending. A urine dipstick is positive for red blood cells. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on laboratory testing?", "answer": "Hypocalcemia", "options": {"A": "Hyperkalemia", "B": "Hyperphosphatemia", "C": "Hyperuricemia", "D": "Hypocalcemia", "E": "Hyponatremia"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient is presenting after running a marathon with hyperthermia and altered mental status suggestive of heatstroke. In the setting of his recent exertion, tonic-clonic seizure, and urine dipstick positive for red blood cells, he is likely suffering from rhabdomyolysis, which most commonly causes hypocalcemia.\n\nRhabdomyolysis occurs when there is a breakdown of the muscle cells. It can occur with exertion (such as marathon running or weight lifting), seizures (from prolonged and intense contraction of the muscles), cocaine use, lightning strikes, electrical injuries, and crush injuries. Damage to muscle cells most commonly causes hypocalcemia from the deposition of calcium in necrotic muscle cells as well as calcium sequestration by the muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness and tetany, altered mental status, and seizure. ECG manifestations of hypocalcemia include QT prolongation. There is no treatment needed for hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis unless it is severe or is causing symptoms such as seizure or ECG changes. The management of rhabdomyolysis involves aggressive IV fluid administration titrated to urine output in order to prevent myoglobin nephrotoxicity. Myoglobin causes the classic false-positive finding of red blood cells on urine dipstick given the cross-reactivity of myoglobin and hemoglobin on this test.\n\nGiannoglou et al. review the pathophysiology and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis. The authors find that hypocalcemia is the most common electrolyte derangement seen in rhabdomyolysis. The authors recommend carefully monitoring ionized calcium in patients with rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte derangement that occurs in rhabdomyolysis and can cause life-threatening dysrhythmias. Initial ECG findings suggestive of hyperkalemia include peaked T waves and QRS widening. The management of hyperkalemia involves the administration of calcium chloride to stabilize cardiac membranes followed by insulin, albuterol, and bicarbonate. Severe/refractory hyperkalemia can be treated with dialysis, but this is usually not needed in rhabdomyolysis. Hyperkalemia is less common when compared to hypocalcemia in rhabdomyolysis and does not cause seizures.\n\nAnswer B: Hyperphosphatemia is common in rhabdomyolysis and occurs secondary to the release of phosphorus from damaged muscle cells. Hyperphosphatemia does not usually require treatment in rhabdomyolysis, though phosphate restriction and phosphate binders can be administered. Hyperphosphatemia can rarely lead to seizures, though this is uncommon.\n\nAnswer C: Hyperuricemia is possible in rhabdomyolysis, occurs secondary to the release of purines from injured muscle cells, and is worsened by acute kidney injury which is common in rhabdomyolysis. The treatment of hyperuricemia in rhabdomyolysis involves IV fluids, rasburicase, and allopurinol (which works slowly).\n\nAnswer E: Hyponatremia may occur after running a marathon where the individual sweats out sodium, chloride, and water but rehydrates with only water. While this is possible in this patient and his seizure could reflect a hyponatremic seizure (which usually would not spontaneously resolve and requires hypertonic saline), there is concrete evidence of rhabdomyolysis with the positive urine dipstick for red blood cells.\n\nBullet Summary:\nRhabdomyolysis can cause hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia (the most common electrolyte disturbance).", "realidx": 204, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 27-year-old man who experiences altered mental status and a seizure during a marathon.

{"question": "A 67-year-old man presents with a recurrent episode of syncope. He states that this has happened to him multiple times, particularly when he changes body position from sitting to standing, exerts himself, or turns his head quickly. He says that he notes numbness, vertigo, and sometimes even trouble with speaking immediately prior to fainting. The episodes usually last 1-5 minutes. When he wakes up, he is mildly confused but typically returns to baseline within a minute. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. His temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 153/89 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. The patient's neurological exam is unremarkable. However, when he is asked to stand up and start walking, he experiences the same numbness and tingling and feels like he may faint.

This is concerning for vertebrobasilar syndrome, caused by blood vessel narrowing.\n\nVertebrobasilar syndrome is caused by narrowing (via causes such as atherosclerosis, dissection, or congenital narrowing among others) of the vertebrobasilar vascular system. It is a common cause of syncope that may be worsened by changes in head position or standing rapidly. Other unique features include numbness/tingling, a sensation of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Note the episodes of syncope in this condition are intermittent and specifically provoked and do not have lasting/permanent neurological deficits in contrast to a stroke. Management is first centered on vascular imaging which may include a CTA head/neck or an MRA head/neck. Further care depends on the symptoms present but typically involves smoking cessation, glycemic control, blood pressure control, aspirin, and a statin.\n\nXuan-Ting et al. review posterior circulation strokes which occur more frequently in patients with atherosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar system. They note that MRI is one of the most accurate tests for assessing posterior circulation strokes which may present with dizziness and syncope. It is far superior to CT imaging. For this reason, they recommend that CT imaging alone cannot definitively rule out a posterior circulation stroke.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Cardiac dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia can cause sudden onset and offset syncope without prodromal symptoms. The differentiating feature of this form of syncope is the rapid onset and offset in a high-risk patient. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an ECG; however, many patients will require prolonged observation on telemetry.\n\nAnswer C: Seizure presents with impaired consciousness, tonic-clonic activity, and a post-ictal state which gradually improves over hours. The lactate may be elevated after a seizure, and the prolactin level is a more specific indicator of a seizure. However, the diagnosis is most appropriately made based on history, exam, and EEG.\n\nAnswer D: Stroke involving the vertebrobasilar system may cause syncope in addition to ongoing dizziness and vertigo with ataxia. However, this patient's symptoms seem to be positional and have entirely resolved; thus, a stroke is unlikely. He is at higher risk of stroke given his vertebrobasilar insufficiency and an MRI should still be performed in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Vagal event presents with a warm prodrome with palpitations, flushing, and syncope. Muscle twitching (but no tonic-clonic activity) may be seen.

The cause is unclear and thought to be autoimmune. The main diagnostic markers are a high FSH and low estradiol at the start of the follicular phase. Patients require estrogen supplementation until around age 50, as low estrogen increases the risk of coronary artery disease, osteoporosis, and sexual dysfunction.

Given his stable respiratory status and oxygen saturation without notable bradypnea, observation alone until the patient is clinically sober is the most appropriate management.\n\nOpioids are commonly used to treat painful conditions but have the potential to become drugs of abuse. Opioid overdose presents with bradypnea, somnolence, decreased bowel sounds, and pinpoint pupils. Any patient who is not protecting their airway, failing to oxygenate, or failing to ventilate should immediately be given naloxone which rapidly reverses the effect of opioids. However, this precipitates withdrawal which is unpleasant for patients and leads to nausea, vomiting, agitation, and diaphoresis among other findings. For this reason, patients who have overdosed on opioids and are stable can be observed until clinically sober.\n\nDietze et al. studied the effect of intranasal versus intramuscular naloxone for opioid overdose in a randomized control trial. The authors found that patients who received intranasal naloxone needed a second dose of naloxone more frequently compared to patients who received intramuscular naloxone. The authors recommend further study of optimal dosing and concentration of intranasal naloxone to respond to opioid overdoses outside of the hospital.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Atropine is an appropriate treatment for a cholinergic toxidrome. This would manifest with bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and drooling. Atropine should be administered until respiratory symptoms improve; large doses may be required.\n\nAnswer B: Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing severe nausea, vomiting, and a very ill feeling when a patient drinks alcohol from the accumulation of byproducts. This drug is a second-line agent used to reduce drinking in chronic alcohol use disorder but has no indication in managing acute alcohol intoxication as it is a preventive medication.\n\nAnswer C: Flumazenil is the reversal agent for benzodiazepines. Its use has fallen out of favor as it can precipitate seizures in chronic benzodiazepine users. Any patient with a suspected benzodiazepine overdose who is protecting their airway should be observed until clinically sober as there is no need to rapidly reverse them and possibly cause seizures.\n\nAnswer D: Naloxone is the antidote of choice in opioid overdose in patients who are not adequately oxygenating, ventilating, or protecting their airway. It is not indicated in opioid overdose in a clinically stable patient as the patient can merely be observed without the unpleasant side effects of immediate withdrawal from naloxone (including vomiting which in some cases could lead to aspiration). This patient is oxygenating well, protecting his airway, and does not have profound bradypnea.\n\nBullet Summary:\nOpioid overdose presents with somnolence, pinpoint pupils, decreased bowel sounds, and bradypnea; stable patients who are adequately breathing and protecting their airway require only observation until clinically sober.", "realidx": 226, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 25-year-old man with altered mental status.

{"question": "A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with pain upon defecation. His symptoms started a few weeks ago but have been worsening. Sometimes he notes blood on the toilet paper. He has to strain to have bowel movements and has trouble defecating secondary to pain. He is generally healthy and does not smoke.

Anal fissures lateral to the midline are associated with inflammatory and infectious etiologies; thus, further workup (testing for HIV, fecal occult blood testing, and sexually transmitted disease testing) is needed rather than merely symptomatic treatment.\n\nAnal fissures present with exquisite pain upon defecation which may lead to fecal retention and constipation. Commonly, anal fissures are caused by constipation, local trauma (such as anal intercourse), or a tight anal sphincter. Anal fissures that occur secondary to trauma are usually midline. On the other hand, lateral anal fissures are a harbinger of more serious alternative diagnoses and require further workup. Lateral anal fissures can be caused by infections (HIV being one of the most concerning as well as syphilis or tuberculosis), Crohn disease, granulomatous disease, malignancy, as well as foreign bodies. For this reason, lateral anal fissures should not only be treated symptomatically but require testing for sexually transmitted diseases, inflammatory conditions, and malignancy to determine the underlying etiology based on the patient\u2019s risk factors and associated symptoms.\n\nSteele and Madoff review anal fissures. They note that while both operative and non-operative interventions may be indicated in the management of an anal fissure after alternative diagnoses have been ruled out, advances in medical management may spare patients sphincter-dividing surgery. They recommend considering all modalities.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis followed by an MRI may be the most appropriate testing if a perirectal abscess is suspected. These abscesses can track very deep. For this reason, further imaging and drainage in the operating room followed by antibiotics are indicated rather than a simple bedside incision and drainage. Imaging may be indicated in this patient after medical workup fails to elucidate an etiology.\n\nAnswer B: Incision, drainage, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole may be indicated for a perianal abscess (note, this is not a perirectal abscess), which presents with a tender, fluctuant mass right next to the anus. The diagnosis can be made clinically or supported by an ultrasound.\n\nAnswer C: Surgical excision may be performed in the management of a perianal fistula, which presents with a draining tract next to the anus that releases purulence or fecal contents causing staining of the patient\u2019s underwear and irritation of the skin. The diagnosis is made with an exam and a CT, MRI, or fistulogram followed by a fistulotomy.\n\nAnswer E: Topical lidocaine, sitz baths, and fiber supplements are the appropriate management of an anal fissure that is midline and secondary to a clear cause such as trauma or constipation.

{"question": "A 6-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for abnormal movements. Several times a day, he experiences paroxysmal episodes of crying, bending at the waist, and jerking of the arms and legs. These episodes last 1-2 seconds, but occur in clusters every 20-30 seconds for several minutes. His mother's pregnancy, labor, delivery, and his neonatal course have been unremarkable.

A 24-hour electroencephalography (EEG) is performed, during which the patient has one of these spells. A chaotic pattern of slowing and multifocal epileptiform charges is seen. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's condition?", "answer": "Excess of corticotropin releasing hormone", "options": {"A": "Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels", "B": "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies", "C": "Decreased gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels", "D": "Excess of corticotropin releasing hormone", "E": "Vitamin B6 deficiency"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient with infantile spasms (bending at the waist and jerking out the arms and legs), developmental regression (rolling over less frequently, worsening head control, loss of social smile), and hypsarrhythmia on video-EEG (slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges) are characteristic of West syndrome. West syndrome is caused in part by an excess of corticotropin-releasing hormone which leads to increased neuronal excitability.\n\nThe pathogenesis of West syndrome is incompletely understood. Infantile spasms are often idiopathic, but may also be secondary to tuberous sclerosis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, congenital brain malformations, aminoacidopathies, and organic acidopathies. Brain insults may activate a neuroendocrine stress response, which in turn leads to abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Disturbed immune activation may also play a role. Patients will present with infantile spasms, developmental regression, and slowing and multifocal epileptiform discharges known as hypsarrhythmia. Many affected infants are responsive to ACTH therapy, with cessation of spasms and resolution of hypsarrhythmia in many cases.\n\nD\u2019Alonzo et al. review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of West syndrome. They discuss how patients will present with the classic symptoms of spasms and regression. They recommend early diagnosis of this syndrome so that patients can be treated appropriately.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Abnormalities in T-type calcium channels may contribute to absence seizures. Absence seizures are generalized seizures that involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness and are more common in children. This child\u2019s developmental regression, infantile spasms, and EEG findings are more consistent with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer C: Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies may cause anti-NMDA encephalitis. Anti-NMDA encephalitis presents with seizures, psychiatric manifestations, and decreased level of consciousness. Hypsarrhythmia is characteristic of West syndrome and is not consistent with anti-NMDA encephalitis.\n\nAnswer D: Decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were once theorized to be the basis of epilepsy syndromes. This theory is less accepted today. Moreover, West syndrome is likely not mediated by disturbances in GABA. Nonetheless, vigabatrin, which in part works by inhibiting GABA metabolism, is an effective medication for patients with West syndrome.\n\nAnswer E: Vitamin B6 deficiency has not been documented in West syndrome. Some studies have suggested vitamin B6 may be of some benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms; however, there is no evidence that response rates to B6 are different from the spontaneous remission rates predicted from natural history data. Therefore, the pathophysiology of West syndrome is more likely CRH-excess mediated rather than due to a deficiency of vitamin B6.\n\nBullet Summary:\nWest syndrome, which may be caused by CRH excess, presents with hypsarrhythmia, developmental regression, and infantile spasms.", "realidx": 236, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette describing a 6-month-old boy with specific symptoms and findings.

If the source patient\u2019s HIV status is unknown, it should be assumed that the patient is HIV positive until testing proves otherwise. The triple antiretroviral drug combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and raltegravir is favored due to the low incidence of side effects.

Tuberous sclerosis is associated with cardiac rhabdomyomas.\n\nTuberous sclerosis is a neurocutaneous disorder that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to unregulated cell growth, leading to the formation of hamartomas in various locations. Manifestations of tuberous sclerosis include seizures (secondary to subependymal nodules and cortical dysplasia), mental retardation, renal angiomyolipomas, facial angiofibromas, mitral regurgitation, and hypomelanotic macules (ash-leaf spots). Cardiac rhabdomyoma is strongly associated with tuberous sclerosis and can lead to arrhythmias. West syndrome, which is characterized by infantile spasms, intellectual disability, and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic mixture of high-amplitude slow waves, multifocal spikes, and intrahemispheric-interhemispheric asynchrony) on EEG, is also associated with tuberous sclerosis. Diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is made with genetic testing. Advanced imaging (CT or MRI) may reveal cortical tubers and lesions in the third and fourth ventricles. Abdominal imaging may reveal renal angiomyolipomas. The management of seizures in tuberous sclerosis includes anti-seizure medications, though surgery may also be pursued in select cases.\n\nHinton et al. studied the cardiac manifestations of tuberous sclerosis.

Diagnosis is with MRI of the brain with contrast to demonstrate leptomeningeal vascular malformations that are characteristic of the disease.\n\nAnswer C: Optic glioma is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which presents with hyperpigmented macules (cafe-au-lait spots), axillary freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas. Neurofibromas in NF1 may also grow on peripheral nerves, leading to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Lisch nodules, or benign growths of the iris, may also be seen in NF1. Diagnosis of NF1 is clinical, but can be aided by genetic testing.\n\nAnswer D: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is associated with McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia causes fibrous tissue in bones, leading to growth abnormalities and pathologic fractures. McCune-Albright syndrome is also associated with cafe-au-lait macules, which have irregular borders, and endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism.

Patients with VHL present with hemangioblastomas in the brain, spinal cord, cerebellum, and retina, and pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations.

In patients without significant trauma, the presence of signs of spinal cord compression (e.g., urinary retention, bowel incontinence, saddle anesthesia, focal neurologic deficits), history of or strong risk factors for cancer, signs of infection, or risk of vertebral compression fracture should prompt additional work-up with imaging such as radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging.

They outline the Waddell signs, which indicate the presence of a functional (signs of excessive pain behavior) aspect of pain. The authors recommend surgical evaluation only in patients with worsening neurologic deficits or intractable pain resistant to conservative treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Herniated discs occurs when the nucleus pulposus herniates through a weakened part of the annulus fibrosus of an intervertebral disc, resulting in spinal nerve root compression. This causes radicular findings at the level of compression, including weakness in hip abduction and ankle dorsiflexion with L5 involvement and weakness in ankle plantarflexion and reduced Achilles reflex with S1 involvement, and radiation of pain into the ipsilateral lower extremity. The straight leg raise test would be positive, as it exacerbates the nerve root compression.\n\nAnswer C: Multiple myeloma presents with hypercalcemia, anemia, renal failure, and lytic bone lesions causing bone pain. This patient has no constitutional symptoms to suggest a malignant process and has a mild elevation in serum calcium, which is likely due to her thiazide diuretic. The clear association of her back pain with exertion makes lumbosacral strain more likely.\n\nAnswer D: Spondylolisthesis occurs when a vertebral body is forwardly subluxated relative to the adjacent vertebral body. This presents as back pain alleviated by rest. Since this can narrow the spinal canal, it may also present with neurogenic claudication, manifesting as buttock or leg pain with walking that can be alleviated by bending forward. This patient\u2019s back pain is not alleviated by rest and is associated with exertion.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fractures can present as back pain in a patient with minor or no trauma.

Duodenal ulcers are often caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, a urease-producing organism.\n\nDuodenal ulcers are erosions and defects in the mucosal lining of the small intestines that allow for damage to the underlying tissues. Patients will classically present with abdominal pain that is localized to the epigastric region. Duodenal ulcers improve upon eating due to the secretion of bicarbonate in the small intestines, whereas gastric ulcers are exacerbated by food due to the release of gastric acid in the stomach. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly caused by infection with H. pylori. If the patient tests positive for H. pylori infection, treatment involves triple therapy with amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a proton pump inhibitor. Patients who fail to improve should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\n\nCiociola et al. studied the prevalence of H. pylori infection in patients with gastric ulcers.

They can be mistaken for inattentiveness in school-aged children. Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presents with a \"jerky\" movement of the patient's extremity that typically occurs in the morning and begins around adolescence. The only medication that can be used to treat both absence seizures and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is valproic acid. Valproic acid inhibits GABA transaminase, blocks thalamic T-type calcium channels, and blocks voltage-gated sodium channels.

IRIS can also occur in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis or leprosy who are started on antimycobacterial treatment. The pathogenesis of IRIS is unclear, but in patients with HIV, antiretroviral therapy increases the amount of CD4+ T-helper cells, which can lead to an exaggerated inflammatory response (e.g., increased cytokine release) towards the infection.

Thus, he should be reassured and maintained on the current dose of his SSRI, with follow-up after the 4 week mark to see if his symptoms have improved.\n\nMajor depressive disorder is managed initially with cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy. The typical first-line medication is an SSRI. SSRIs may take at least 4 weeks or more to begin working, so patients that return before this time period should be reassured and encouraged to let the medication take effect as long as they are not experiencing suicidal thoughts or intent. If the medication is not working after at least 4 weeks, the next steps in management could include increasing the dose of the current medication, changing SSRIs, adding another antidepressant agent, or adding a low dose of levothyroxine. All patients with suicidal ideation and either intent or a plan to hurt themselves should be hospitalized involuntarily.\n\nGautam et al. discuss the current management algorithms for major depressive disorder. They note different options including CBT and pharmacotherapy.

However, it would not be attempted at this point given this patient has not given his current medication sufficient time to begin working. There is limited evidence to support its use overall. Note that this patient's TSH is within normal limits. In some cases, T3 administration is used in refractory depression.\n\nAnswer B: Changing the medication to bupropion could be appropriate in patients who want to avoid weight gain, those who want to quit smoking, or those who are trying to avoid sexual side effects. It also is an appropriate second-line agent or could be added to a first-line agent; however, this patient\u2019s current medication should be tried for at least 4 weeks before changing medications.\n\nAnswers 3 & 4: Changing medication to escitalopram or increasing the dose of the current medication are both viable strategies if a patient has failed to improve on their first medication after at least 4 weeks on the medication.

The most likely heart sound in this patient is an S4 gallop that occurs immediately before S1.\n\nChronic hypertension that is poorly controlled can lead to concentric hypertrophy of the heart. This adaptive mechanism creates a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle. When blood enters this stiff ventricle, the typical sound heard is an S4 heart sound which is heard right before S1. This sound represents the atrial kick that pushes blood against a non-compliant left ventricle in the last phase of diastole. Treatment is by meticulous control of the underlying cardiac pathophysiology such as hypertension.\n\nKino et al studied the relationship between the S1 and S4 heart sounds in aging patients. They found that an S4 heart sound can be missed in cases of prominent S1 splitting. They recommend studying heart sounds in order to not accidentally miss an S4 finding.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Fixed splitting of S1 and S2 describes an atrial septal defect. The atrial septic defect allows blood to communicate between both sides of the heart and equalizes atrial pressures. Asymptomatic patients may not need treatment but surgical repair of the defect should be performed in symptomatic cases.\n\nAnswer B: A heart sound after S2 suggests a S3 heart sound which would be found in fluid-overloaded states such as heart failure. This post-systolic gallop is the result of incomplete emptying of the ventricle prior to the start of diastole so that the blood from the atria falls against an already full chamber.

Though this patient does have episodes of blank staring, this likely does not represent a seizure as he is arousable to return to work by his boss. Patients with absence seizures typically present in childhood and are unable to be aroused during seizure episodes.\n\nAnswer B: Polysomnography or a sleep study would be indicated after sleep hygiene practices have failed. Polysomnography could be the most appropriate initial step in management if there was a suspected diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea or an unknown cause of this patient's fatigue. Patients with sleep apnea typically snore and this disease is associated with obesity and increasing age.\n\nAnswer D: Modafinil is a treatment for narcolepsy. Though this patient does have sudden episodes of falling asleep while at work, this is more likely to be related to his sleep schedule. Patients with narcolepsy generally do not feel tired immediately before their episodes of sleep.\n\nAnswer E: Zolpidem is a muscle relaxant and hypnotic with the mechanism of action of a benzodiazepine. Though a drug like zolpidem could be used to help this patient fall asleep, the most appropriate first step is to address the patient's sleep hygiene prior to prescribing a potentially addictive drug.\n\nBullet Summary:\nThe most appropriate initial step in the management of patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome is behavioral therapy, bright light therapy, and sleep hygiene.", "realidx": 298, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 25-year-old man with symptoms suggestive of a sleep disorder, possibly narcolepsy or another condition affecting his sleep-wake cycle.

{"question": "A 7-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents for worsening symptoms of previously diagnosed acute sinusitis. Initially, the pediatrician prescribed decongestants and sent the patient home. Since then, the patient has developed a nasal discharge with worsening pain. The patient has a medical history of asthma which is well-controlled with albuterol. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/48 mmHg, pulse is 124/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Inspection of the patient's nose reveals a unilateral purulent discharge mixed with blood. The rest of the patient's exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Foreign body obstruction", "options": {"A": "Bleeding and infected vessel of Kiesselbach plexus", "B": "Foreign body obstruction", "C": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma", "D": "Septal perforation", "E": "Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This patient presents with unilateral bloody/purulent discharge from the nose suggesting a diagnosis of a nasal foreign body.\n\nThe most common cause of unilateral nasal symptoms in a pediatric patient is a nasal foreign body. Nasal foreign bodies tend to be unilateral (though bilateral symptoms are plausible) and present with a purulent and bloody discharge. The treatment of choice is to remove the object which may be done in the emergency department or operating room depending on how deep the object is. Visualization of the object should be attempted when possible in order to allow for safe retrieval.\n\nKrulewitz and Fix review the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epistaxis. They discuss how foreign body insertion is a major risk factor for the development of epistaxis. They recommend assessment of airway and breathing in the setting of severe epistaxis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: A bleeding and infected vessel of the Kiesselbach plexus could suggest a complicated case of epistaxis. The persistent, unilateral symptoms in this patient point toward a different diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for foreign bodies should be suspected in children.\n\nAnswer C: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma tends to occur in young male patients and can be associated with infectious mononucleosis. Epistaxis can be a symptom and the mass can be visualized. This disease tends to present in older patients and is far less common than foreign bodies. Treatment is with surgical resection.\n\nAnswer D: Septal perforation can occur secondary to repeat cocaine use but would not present with unilateral nasal discharge in a pediatric patient. It would be highly unlikely in a pediatric patient with no history of drug use. Treatment is with cessation of the offending agent.\n\nAnswer E: Sinusitis with bacterial superinfection would typically present with systemic symptoms as well as bilateral symptoms. Though this diagnosis is possible, it is less likely than a foreign body. Treatment is with systemic antibiotic therapy.\n\nBullet Summary:\nA nasal foreign body presents with unilateral bloody/purulent nasal discharge.", "realidx": 303, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette describing a 7-year-old boy with worsening symptoms of acute sinusitis.
