Symptoms are normally gradual in onset and can include headache, fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia. The most appropriate initial test is a lumbar puncture with an India ink stain. Cerebrospinal fluid in fungal meningitis would have low glucose, elevated protein, and an elevated lymphocyte-dominant leukocyte count. The most accurate diagnostic test is latex particle agglutination. Intrathecal amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine are the first-line treatments for acute management.

This is the most common cause of meningitis in adults, elderly, and asplenic patients, and can spread to cause sinusitis, otitis media, or bacteremia.\n\nAnswer D: Fluconazole is used for prophylaxis against cryptococcal meningitis after a person is treated acutely. It is either given for life, or until the patient\u2019s CD4+ count is > 100/mm^3. This treatment is not sufficient for patients with acute meningitis with neurological changes.\n\nAnswer E: Vancomycin and ceftriaxone are given to a patient suspected of having bacterial meningitis until culture results confirm the bacterial organism.

An insulinoma is a beta cell tumor that secretes insulin.\n\nAn insulinoma is a beta cell tumor of the pancreas. The beta cells normally secrete insulin in response to increased circulating fuel substrate (such as glucose or fat). In the setting of an insulinoma, insulin is pathologically and continuously secreted. This leads to profound, recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia. When a patient presents with hypoglycemia of unclear etiology; a blood glucose level, C-peptide level, and sulfonylurea level should be ordered. An infectious workup may be indicated as sepsis can also cause hypoglycemia. In an insulinoma, patients will be hypoglycemic, have an elevated C-peptide level (as this is a marker of endogenous insulin release), and a negative sulfonylurea level (important to rule out as a sulfonylurea overdose can also cause hypoglycemia in the setting of an elevated C-peptide level). Further workup will involve imaging of the abdomen such as a CT scan or MRI (more accurate) to delineate this insulin-secreting mass.\n\nMathur et al. discuss insulinoma. They note that it is a rare endocrine tumor, and note its association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. They recommend workup for an insulinoma should occur in patients with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia without a clear cause.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alpha cell tumor describes a glucagonoma, which pathologically secretes glucagon leading to profound hyperglycemia, a classic rash termed necrolytic migratory erythema (presents with painful, erythematous papules and plaques), and gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\nAnswer B: Beta cell destruction describes the pathophysiology of type I diabetes mellitus, which presents in pediatric patients (most commonly) with hyperglycemia, weight loss, polydipsia, and polyuria. Treatment involves the administration of insulin. An initial presentation of type I diabetes may be diabetic ketoacidosis which presents with dehydration, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, Kussmaul respirations, and an anion gap acidosis.\n\nAnswer D: Insulin overdose would present with hypoglycemia, somnolence, confusion, and tremulousness. Note that exogenous insulin administration would not elevate the C-peptide level, which is a marker of endogenous insulin production.\n\nAnswer E: Sulfonylurea overdose would cause hypoglycemia that is often persistent given the long half-life of sulfonylureas. It would also elevate the C-peptide level as these medications increase the endogenous release of insulin. However, the sulfonylurea level was negative in this patient. While iatrogenic use of medications is plausible in this patient who has knowledge of medications (as she is a nurse), her repeat episodes and her workup suggesting against an iatrogenic etiology makes an insulinoma a more likely diagnosis.\n\nBullet Summary:\nInsulinomas are beta cell tumors of the pancreas and lead to severe hypoglycemia and an elevated insulin and C-peptide level.", "realidx": 7, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results.

Radioiodine ablation is the preferred definitive management for Graves disease, which can worsen exophthalmos.\n\nGraves disease is an autoimmune hyperthyroid disorder caused by antibodies to the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which induce production of T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). Overstimulation of the thyroid gland by TSHR antibodies results in diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, termed \u201cgoiter.\u201d TSHR is also highly expressed in retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts, where overstimulation by TSHR antibodies (and activated T-cells) leads to the expansion of retro-ocular connective tissue and extra-ocular muscle volume. This causes exophthalmos (bulging eyes) and is referred to as Graves ophthalmopathy or orbitopathy. Beta blockers are used to achieve acute sympathetic control in hyperthyroid Graves patients, and antithyroid medications (propylthiouracil or methimazole) are initiated to achieve a euthyroid state. Radioactive iodine ablation is first-line definitive management, particularly, for individuals with unsuccessful anti-thyroid medication management. Radioiodine ablation has been known to increase TSHR-antibodies, likely secondary to the leakage of thyroid antigens, and thus exophthalmos is often worsened after treatment. For this reason, corticosteroids are often co-administrated as a prophylactic measure.\n\nDavies et al. review Graves disease including the pathophysiology and management. They note that Graves orbitopathy may be worsened by radioiodine ablation. They recommend further studies and advancements in care given this lasting complication.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Hair loss can occur in hyperthyroid and hypothyroid states due to altered hair follicle stem cell function. However, this process is typically reversed, not worsened, after achieving a euthyroid state.\n\nAnswer C: Heat intolerance occurs in Graves disease due to hyperthyroid-induced sympathetic overactivity, which resolves after successful treatment.\n\nAnswer D: Menstrual irregularity occurs in hyperthyroidism through altered levels of sex hormone binding globulin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and prolactin. However, treatment of hyperthyroidism typically restores menstrual regularity. After ablation, patients will be hypothyroid; however, the standard of care is to start the patient on levothyroxine which should prevent this complication.\n\nAnswer E: Thyromegaly in Graves disease is caused by diffuse overactivation of the thyroid gland by the TSHR antibodies. Once treated with radioactive iodine (I-131), the thyroid gland gradually shrinks in size. Patients who undergo radioactive iodine ablation will later require life-long thyroxine supplementation due to resulting hypothyroidism.\n\nBullet Summary:\nDefinitive therapy for Graves disease is radioiodine ablation, which leads to increased TSHR antibodies and worsened exophthalmos from overactivation of TSHR-rich retro-ocular adipocytes and fibroblasts.", "realidx": 12, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 30-year-old woman with symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, menstrual irregularity, hair loss, heat intolerance, tachycardia, tremors, thyromegaly, and exophthalmos.

The headache started suddenly while she was eating dinner and she says it feels like the \u201cworst headache of my life.\u201d An emergent CT scan of the head without contrast confirms the diagnosis, and a CT angiogram identifies the source of bleeding. The patient undergoes surgical management of her condition. On hospital day 3, she is found to be disoriented to person, place, and time. She also develops nausea and vomiting. Her medical problems consist of heart failure for which she takes furosemide, spironolactone, and metoprolol, which were continued at admission.

In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia.

Radiographs of the spine will show squaring of vertebrae with vertical or marginal syndesmophytes resulting in a \"bamboo spine\" appearance. The earliest radiographic sign is the erosion of the iliac side of the sacroiliac joint, but this finding is not sensitive in the early stages of the disease. MRI is sensitive in detecting sacroiliac inflammation, which makes this the best modality for early detection of ankylosing spondylitis in young patients. Initial therapy for ankylosing spondylitis includes lifestyle modifications (exercise, smoking cessation, physical therapy) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

She has taken him to a free health clinic to have him seen by a doctor who prescribed medication; however, she has been unable to fill the prescription. He has had an MRI of the brain with no acute findings in the past. The mother states this episode lasted about 3 minutes and involved full-body jerking. After the episode, the child was non-responsive but was breathing on his own. The child has a history of migraine headaches with aura that resolve with ibuprofen. He is otherwise healthy and has no medical problems or recent illness and is up to date on his vaccinations. His temperature is 97.6\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/64 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is protecting his airway but is unable to answer questions. He is able to move the right upper and lower extremity. He initially is unable to move his left upper and lower extremity and has a left facial droop; however, after a few minutes, he has 4/5 strength in the affected side with resolution of his facial weakness. The mother notes that this is similar to his past episodes. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?", "answer": "Observation", "options": {"A": "Alteplase", "B": "CT head", "C": "Diazepam", "D": "Observation", "E": "Sumatriptan"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient is presenting after a seizure (tonic-clonic jerking of his extremities) and is currently postictal given that he is obtunded. Given that the patient is not moving the left side of his body, he is likely suffering from Todd paralysis, which can occur after seizures and resolves on its own with only observation.\n\nA generalized tonic-clonic seizure may present with full-body tonic-clonic activity with altered mental status. After a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, patients can be postictal and appear to be obtunded. Other than ensuring adequate oxygenation/ventilation and evaluating for the cause of the seizure, there is no further intervention needed as this postictal state will improve with time. After seizures, some patients present with Todd paralysis, which is a focal paralysis after a seizure. This may mimic a stroke, and thus the patient\u2019s risk factors and known seizure history should be factored into the decision. Todd paralysis does not require any intervention and will improve with time and observation only.\n\nXu et al. review Todd paralysis. They note that Todd paralysis is characterized by temporary limb weakness or hemiplegia and usually occurs following a seizure. They recommend that it can be difficult to differentiate Todd paralysis from a stroke in certain patient populations.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAnswer A: Alteplase is a thrombolytic that could be used in an acute ischemic stroke if given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset without any contraindications to its use. It would only be given after the CT scan of the head has been performed and other reversible causes have been addressed in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Alteplase is not given when neurologic symptoms are thought to be secondary to Todd paralysis. In fact, seizure and Todd paralysis would be a contraindication to thrombolytic use in stroke.\n\nAnswer B: CT head, in addition to a fingerstick blood glucose, should immediately be performed in all patients with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits thought to be secondary to a stroke. A stroke would present with sudden onset focal neurologic deficits. However, it is common for patients to be obtunded and have focal neurologic deficits after a seizure and this would not warrant a stroke workup unless clinical suspicion exists. This patient has no risk factors for stroke and his improving strength suggests against a stroke. Moreover, he has a history of a normal MRI of the brain.\n\nAnswer C: Diazepam would only be given for a patient who is actively seizing as it is a benzodiazepine with a long half-life. Note that it is not indicated in a postictal patient as there is no ongoing seizure. Benzodiazepines are not given as preventive measures for seizures.\n\nAnswer E: Sumatriptan may be indicated to treat a migraine, which presents with a pulsatile, unilateral headache and is more common in women. Hemiplegic migraine can cause focal neurologic deficits, and it would be reasonable to treat a migraine headache if a patient had focal neurologic deficits and a history of known hemiplegic migraines. Patients will either have a frequent history of hemiplegic migraines themselves or in their family.\n\nBullet Summary:\nFocal neurologic deficits (Todd paralysis) can be seen after a seizure and will resolve with observation.", "realidx": 24, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 7-year-old boy who experiences episodes of jerking movements followed by confusion, which are suggestive of seizures.

{"question": "A 55-year-old woman presents to a primary care physician with persistent nausea and abdominal discomfort. She has experienced these symptoms daily for the past 3 months. She feels bloated and has episodic loose and watery stools. She has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia for which she takes amlodipine and atorvastatin.

The most appropriate next step in management is to obtain a stool ova and parasite assay.\n\nAscaris lumbricoides is a roundworm that is transmitted via the fecal-oral route (egg ingestion). While most patients are asymptomatic, there can be pulmonary and intestinal manifestations in the early and late phases, respectively. Pulmonary signs include dry cough, dyspnea, fever, and wheezing. Intestinal signs include abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, and/or anorexia. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients with vague abdominal symptoms with travel history to an endemic area. The diagnosis is secured with stool microscopy for eggs or worms. Complications of this condition include intestinal obstruction or hepatobiliary/pancreatic involvement, presenting as biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and/or ascending cholangitis. Treatment in patients with uncomplicated infection is with anti-helminth therapy (albendazole or mebendazole).\n\nParija et al. review the epidemiology of helminth infections globally.

Bowel obstruction is an acute process that would be unlikely in this patient with chronic symptoms. Although bowel obstruction is a complication of Ascaris infection, this patient has no signs of obstruction.

A urine chloride test can be used to distinguish between these possibilities because urine chloride will be high in diuretic abuse and will be low/normal in surreptitious vomiting.\n\nMetabolic alkalosis is an acid-base disorder that is due to an increased level of serum bicarbonate. This increase can be secondary to increased bicarbonate intake or loss of hydrogen ions. Etiologies consistent with increased intake include antacid use or milk-alkali syndrome. Etiologies consistent with hydrogen ion loss include gastrointestinal losses such as vomiting or renal losses such as hyperaldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, or diuretic abuse. Urine chloride can distinguish between gastrointestinal and renal losses because urine chloride levels will be high in patients with renal tubule dysfunction or diuretic abuse. This is due to increased urinary excretion of ammonium chloride in cases of diarrhea. On the other hand, urine chloride will generally be low in hyperaldosteronism due to loss of chloride with vomiting.\n\nWu et al. studied the causes of chronic hypokalemia as well as laboratory findings that can be used to distinguish between different etiologies. They show how urine sodium and chloride can be helpful for identifying the surreptitious use of diuretics. The authors recommend the use of the sodium-to-chloride excretion ratio to help diagnose patients with chronic normotensive hypokalemia.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Arterial blood gas is useful for determining the acid-base state of a patient because it simultaneously measures carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels. This test is not as useful in determining different causes of metabolic alkalosis because all of these etiologies will have similar findings (high bicarbonate and compensatory high carbon dioxide), especially in patient who has already received a venous blood gas.\n\nAnswer B: Complete blood count is useful for determining whether a patient is anemic resulting in decreased oxygen delivery to end organs due to decreased carrying capacity for oxygen. In cases of severe anemia and hypoperfusion, peripheral tissues produce lactic acid which will result in an anion gap metabolic acidosis rather than metabolic alkalosis.\n\nAnswer C: Serum glucose elevation can result in increased diuresis as well as pseudohyponatremia (decreased measured sodium due to increased glucose). Alternatively, acidosis may also be caused by insulin deficiency in diabetic ketoacidosis. Neither of these findings is consistent with the lab results seen in this patient.\n\nAnswer E: Urine toxicology can be used to determine whether the patient is taking any substances of abuse.

Riluzole, a glutamate inhibitor, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medication that improves survival in patients with ALS.\n\nALS is a neurodegenerative disease that affects both upper and lower motor neurons. Upper motor neuron signs include spasticity and hyperreflexia, while lower motor neuron signs include muscle atrophy and fasciculations (spontaneous, involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation). In patients with bulbar-onset ALS, the initial clinical presentation is dysarthria, dysphagia, tongue atrophy, and abnormal jaw jerk reflex.

Riluzole improves survival by 2-6 months in patients with ALS and may have a greater survival benefit in patients with bulbar-onset ALS.\n\nMasori and Van Damme review the genetics, pathophysiology, classic clinical presentation, extra-motor manifestations, diagnostic workup, and treatment for ALS. They discuss how riluzole provides a survival benefit in patients with this disease. They recommend treating patients with ALS using riluzole as tolerated.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist that reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters to decrease spasticity in ALS. Along with tizanidine, baclofen is a first-line symptomatic treatment for spasticity in ALS. Baclofen does not improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer B: Dextromethorphan and quinidine is a combination of a sigma opioid receptor agonist and a sodium channel blocker used to control pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS. Pseudobulbar affect is a sudden uncontrollable outburst of laughter or tearfulness that affects almost half of patients with ALS. Dextromethorphan and quinidine has not been shown to improve survival in ALS.\n\nAnswer C: Edaravone is an intravenous antioxidant that may decrease the progression of early ALS.

The most appropriate next step in management is performing a colonoscopy.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of hematochezia includes colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, diverticulosis, and hemorrhoids. The evaluation depends in large part on the age of the patient and whether the patient presents with alarm symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, or iron-deficiency anemia. If the patient is over the age of 50, has alarm symptoms, or has a family history of colorectal cancer, the evaluation should begin with a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. If the patient is between the ages of 40 and 50 and without other red flags, the patient can elect to undergo sigmoidoscopy as a less invasive procedure than colonoscopy. If the patient is under the age of 40 and without alarm symptoms, the workup may begin with an anoscopy to first evaluate for hemorrhoids.

{"question": "A 14-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician with a 2-month history of intermittent arm and leg spasms. He says that the spasms usually occur after he wakes up as he is getting ready for school, and consist of disorganized jerking motions that stop after a few minutes. He has also noticed that they occur when he stays up late to cram last minute for exams. He has not noticed any other symptoms. He has no medical history and takes no medications. He recently started experimenting with alcohol and marijuana that one of his friends has been stealing from their parents. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/70 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Physical exam reveals a healthy child.

These myoclonic jerks usually have an onset occurring in early adolescence in otherwise healthy children. Myoclonic jerks are most frequently seen right after waking from sleep, but they may also be triggered by lack of sleep, stress, or alcohol consumption. Patients with this disease rarely have associated symptoms but may occasionally also experience absence seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The diagnosis can be secured with a history of seizures alongside an interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) that shows 4 to 6 Hz bilateral polyspikes. Valproate is the first-line treatment.\n\nJohannessen et al. discuss the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. They find that standard antiepileptic treatment with agents such as valproate leads to only 33% of patients remaining seizure-free. They recommend trials of alternative antiepileptic medications such as levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and topiramate in patients that do not respond to valproate.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Absence seizures commonly present during childhood in otherwise healthy children; however, these seizures are typically characterized by short episodes of loss of awareness known as \"staring spells\" without physical manifestations.\n\nAnswer B: Alcohol intoxication is a risk factor for precipitating juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, but alcohol use does not cause this condition. Seizure activity may also occur during alcohol withdrawal, but the timing of this patient's symptoms is more suggestive of seizure symptoms. Alcohol withdrawal requires chronic drinking of large amounts leading to an increase in central nervous system N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and a decrease in CNS gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. When alcohol cessation occurs, seizures ensue.\n\nAnswer C: Cannabinoid use is not associated with seizure activity either during intoxication or withdrawal. Patients may have altered mental status, but this does not manifest as myoclonic jerks.\n\nAnswer E: West syndrome is an infantile seizure disorder that usually presents between 3 months and 12 months of age.

The appropriate treatment for this is supportive care with return precautions (instructing the mother to bring the child back to a physician if he becomes short of breath).\n\nViral pharyngitis in children is most often caused by adenovirus, though other viruses can cause the condition as well. The diagnosis is clinical, with a presentation of fever, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, sore throat, and cough. Features that can help distinguish viral pharyngitis from pneumonia include a lack of tachypnea, increased work of breathing, hypoxemia, or adventitial lung sounds. No additional testing or intervention is necessary. The illness is typically self-limited and resolves with supportive care.\n\nShapiro et al. study features predictive of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis in children. The authors found that among patients with features of viral illness, patients older than 11 years of age who did not have a fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, or tonsillar exudates were at the lowest risk for GAS. The authors recommend against testing low-risk children for GAS to avoid antibiotic treatment in patients merely colonized with GAS.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Administering antitoxin and toxoid vaccine is the treatment for Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection. Although this child has not received his age-appropriate vaccinations, his presentation is not concerning for infection with diphtheria. C. diphtheriae infection presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and gray pseudomembranes on pharyngeal exam, neither of which this child has.\n\nAnswer B: Amoxicillin should be given in cases of group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis. Before amoxicillin is prescribed, testing with Streptococcal rapid antigen detection testing should be performed. Additionally, rapid antigen detection testing is not indicated in this patient as she has a cough and does not have cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, or palatal petechiae. All of these findings are not typical of GAS pharyngitis.\n\nAnswer C: Influenza testing and oseltamivir are indicated if the child had myalgias or high fevers that would make influenza more likely and if he presented within 2 days of symptom onset. Oseltamivir is only approved for treating influenza in uncomplicated cases if started within this 2-day window from symptom onset. Exceptions to this 2-day guideline include adults greater than 65 years of age, pregnant women, residents of long-term care facilities, American Indians, persons with BMI greater than 40 kg/m^2, and those receiving immunosuppressive medications.\n\nAnswer D: Obtaining a chest radiograph and respiratory virus panel can be done when a lower respiratory infection such as bacterial pneumonia is expected. However, viral infections are much more common than bacterial pneumonia in this age group. Additionally, this patient is not tachypneic, does not have evidence of increased work of breathing, and is not hypoxemic, all of which make bacterial pneumonia less likely.\n\nBullet Summary:\nViral pharyngitis in children is a clinical diagnosis consisting of fever, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis, cough, sore throat, and pharyngeal erythema, and is treated with supportive care.", "realidx": 49, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a 4-year-old boy with symptoms of a respiratory illness.

The patient is obese, and her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. She recently underwent Achilles tendon repair. She otherwise is known to smoke cigarettes on occasion. Physical exam is notable for a critically ill patient with chest compressions ongoing. The monitor shows pulseless electrical activity. Her right lower extremity is in a post-operative splint. The patient regains her pulse after several rounds of CPR and epinephrine.

Given the bedside echocardiograph that is notable for a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing into a hyperkinetic left ventricle, the most likely diagnosis is a pulmonary embolism that is causing obstructive shock.\n\nPulmonary embolism is most commonly caused by a deep vein thrombosis in the veins of the lower extremity that travels to the pulmonary circulation. Patients will present with pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, sinus tachycardia, and hemoptysis. Massive pulmonary emboli can cause hemodynamic instability. Patients may become hypotensive, tachycardic, and ultimately pulseless. The pulmonary embolism can obstruct blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery, leading to a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with septal bowing and a hyperdynamic left ventricle. This is a type of obstructive shock. Treatment of a massive pulmonary embolism causing hemodynamic instability may involve thrombolytics or thrombectomy.\n\nStandl et al. review obstructive shock. They note that obstructive shock is caused by an obstruction of blood flow out of (or in the case of tamponade, into) the heart. They recommend that treating the underlying cause is the only effective management option.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cardiogenic shock is caused by cardiac dysfunction in conditions such as myocardial infarction or heart failure. Cardiac dysfunction then leads to impaired systemic perfusion. Initial management includes treating the underlying cause (e.g., cardiac catheterization for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and vasopressors (e.g., norepinephrine) to maintain the patient\u2019s blood pressure.\n\nAnswer B: Hemorrhagic shock is a common cause of shock in trauma and presents with hypotension and tachycardia secondary to blood loss. A narrowed pulse pressure may be the first sign of hemorrhagic shock. The mainstay of management is blood transfusion and an intervention to stop the bleeding.\n\nAnswer C: Neurogenic shock occurs when there is central nervous system trauma (often to the cervical spine) leading to decreased sympathetic tone systemically. Patients will present with hypotension and bradycardia (contrast with tachycardia in hemorrhagic shock), and management is centered on vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and neurosurgical intervention for the underlying etiology. IV fluids can also be given to maintain blood pressure.\n\nAnswer E: Septic shock occurs when a systemic infection leads to vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction with hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation.

She reports that about 2 weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. He seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. His mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies.

Cervical spondylosis is a common cause of cervical radiculopathy in elderly patients with chronic neck pain, especially in patients with findings suggestive of degenerative joint diseases (history of lumbar fusion and hip arthroplasty).\n\nCervical spondylosis is caused by degeneration of the intervertebral disc with possible disc herniation and facet joints with osteophyte formation. These osteophytes and cervical disc herniation can cause compression of exiting nerve roots, leading to radiculopathy. Radicular symptoms depend on the nerve root affected. For example, C6 radiculopathy causes weakness in wrist extension and a decreased brachioradialis reflex while C7 radiculopathy causes weakness in elbow extension and wrist flexion with a decreased triceps reflex. Sensory symptoms may be present depending on the dermatome affected. The diagnosis is confirmed with MRI.

{"question": "A 34-year-old nulliparous woman presents to the clinic with 2 weeks of copper-colored discharge from her right nipple. Her breast has not been tender, and she has not noticed any changes to the skin. She is otherwise healthy and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), blood pressure is 110/82 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Exam of the right breast reveals no mass on palpation. Bloody discharge is expressed from the right nipple. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?", "answer": "Intraductal papilloma", "options": {"A": "Ductal carcinoma in situ", "B": "Intraductal papilloma", "C": "Invasive ductal carcinoma", "D": "Mammary duct ectasia", "E": "Paget disease of the breast"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This young patient who presents with non-painful unilateral bloody nipple discharge and no palpable mass on breast exam most likely has an intraductal papilloma.\n\nIntraductal papilloma is a benign epithelial tumor that develops in the lactiferous ducts of the breast and is the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge in premenopausal women. Patients typically present with painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and often there is no mass palpable on breast exam. Ultrasound is the initial method for evaluation and may reveal an intraductal mass, but if results are inconclusive, further imaging with mammography is indicated. If the results of both still remain inconclusive, galactography (radiography after injecting radiopaque contrast into the duct system) is the most accurate imaging method for diagnosing intraductal papilloma. A core biopsy of the intraductal mass should be obtained, and if results show papilloma with atypia, treatment would be surgical excision of the involved duct to rule out a concomitant malignant neoplasm.\n\nKhan et al. review the treatment of intraductal papilloma and note that in lesions with core biopsy showing papilloma with atypia, surgical excision revealed the diagnosis of a concomitant invasive or ductal in situ cancer is common. The authors also find that in patients whose core biopsies showed papilloma without atypia, the likelihood of cancer was much lower. The authors recommend that since the diagnosis of intraductal papilloma carries an increased risk of breast cancer compared to the general population, these patients should be monitored accordingly.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a neoplastic lesion confined to the breast duct that if untreated develops into invasive ductal carcinoma. Typically, patients are asymptomatic, and lesions are detected via screening mammography. Though it can sometimes present with nipple discharge, this is less common. Unilateral painless bloody nipple discharge is more likely to be due to intraductal papilloma, though no mass may be palpable for either diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, which typically presents as a firm, immobile, painless lump in the breast, sometimes associated with nipple discharge, overlying skin changes, inverted nipple, and/or axillary lymphadenopathy. As with DCIS, nipple discharge may be present but is usually not bloody as in cases of intraductal papilloma.\n\nAnswer D: Mammary duct ectasia is a benign condition in which a milk duct in the breast widens and its walls thicken, leading to blockage and build-up of fluid in the duct. This is usually asymptomatic but can present with off-white or greenish nipple discharge. It may also result in infection of the affected duct, leading to periductal mastitis and a tender, erythematous breast. It tends to occur in perimenopausal women and often resolves without treatment, though if symptoms persist it can be treated with antibiotics and duct excision.\n\nAnswer E: Paget disease of the breast often presents as a scaly, raw, vesicular, or ulcerated lesion that begins on the nipple and then spreads to the areola, sometimes associated with bloody nipple discharge. Pain, burning, and pruritis are also common presenting symptoms. There is often an underlying breast carcinoma; thus, any patient with Paget disease should be evaluated with a mammogram. Although this patient has bloody nipple discharge, she does not present with a painful, scaly, raw, or vesiculated lesion that would be concerning for Paget disease of the breast.\n\nBullet Summary:\nIntraductal papilloma often manifests in patients as painless unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and typically no mass is palpable on exam.", "realidx": 69, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 34-year-old woman with specific symptoms and examination findings related to her breast.

In the setting of serum hypo-osmolality, urine hyper-osmolality, urine sodium concentration > 20 mEq/L, and hypovolemia (low blood pressure, decreased skin turgor, and prolonged capillary refill), this is indicative of cerebral salt wasting.\n\nThe mechanism of cerebral salt wasting is unclear, although some hypotheses point to increased release of brain natriuretic peptide after injury leading to suppression of renal sodium reabsorption, or sympathetic nervous system injury resulting in an impaired renin response. Patients classically present several days after cerebral injury or neurosurgery with hypovolemic hyponatremia and hypochloremia. Water retention results in serum hypo-osmolality, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia with urine hyper-osmolality and increased urine sodium excretion. In patients with prolonged cerebral salt wasting, hypokalemia can also occur (potassium may be normal in acute states). Treatment in mild or moderate cases consists of normal saline infusion to correct both volume status and hyponatremia. Treatment in severe cases consists of hypertonic saline. During correction, serum sodium must be monitored closely to prevent central pontine myelinolysis.\n\nCui et al. describe the differences between syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral salt wasting. They discuss how volume status serves as the key differentiator between these conditions. They recommend paying closer attention to total body electrolyte balance in understanding these conditions.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Addison disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, results in salt wasting due to decreased mineralocorticoid activity. Because of reduced aldosterone release, patients also have hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In contrast, this patient\u2019s potassium and bicarbonate levels are normal. Treatment is with steroids.\n\nAnswer C: Diuretic overuse is occasionally observed in patients using loop diuretics. Overuse of loop diuretics can cause hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremia. Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen due to volume contraction. Cerebral salt wasting is more likely in this patient presenting after a recent cerebral injury. Treatment is the cessation of the causative medication.\n\nAnswer D: Primary polydipsia can cause symptomatic hyponatremia. The urine would be maximally diluted (urine osmolality < 100 mEq/L) due to an appropriate physiological response to hyponatremia and excess free water intake. Treatment is cessation of excessive water consumption.\n\nAnswer E: Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) presents with identical findings as cerebral salt wasting with the exception of euvolemia as opposed to hypovolemia. An assessment of volume status is essential to differentiate. This patient has clear signs of hypovolemia.

Normally, bladder contraction occurs due to the stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the detrusor muscle. Urinary urge incontinence is due to detrusor overactivity, leading to a sudden and frequently overwhelming need to void that occurs throughout the day and night. The most common cause is idiopathic, though it may be secondary to neurologic disorders (e.g., spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis), bladder abnormalities, or chronic bladder inflammation. Workup is first centered on ruling out a urinary tract infection with a urinalysis. The diagnosis is made with urodynamic studies, and first-line treatment involves bladder training and pelvic floor exercises. Should first-line treatment of urge incontinence fail, antimuscarinic medications (such as oxybutynin) which reduce acetylcholine activity on muscarinic receptors can decrease detrusor contraction and thus the sense of urgency.\n\nNandy and Ranganathan review urge incontinence.

{"question": "A 51-year-old man presents for his annual wellness visit with his primary care physician. His wife has noticed a tremor while he is working on his car and knows that his father died of Parkinson disease. He says that the tremor is nothing to worry about and only occurs during a few activities such as pouring drinks, pointing the remote at the television, or fixing his car. The patient states his wife is just overreacting. His medical problems include hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia for which he takes lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has 3-5 drinks of scotch per night before working on his car. On physical exam, the tremor is replicated during finger to nose testing. Romberg sign is negative. Cranial nerves II-XII are intact. The rest of the exam is benign. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's tremor?", "answer": "Propranolol", "options": {"A": "Alcoholics anonymous", "B": "Aripiprazole", "C": "Carbidopa", "D": "Phenobarbital", "E": "Propranolol"}, "answer_idx": "E", "reason": "This patient who presents with a tremor that only occurs during terminal activity and is likely improved by alcohol (hence why he drinks prior to working on the car) has benign essential tremor. This is best treated with propranolol.\n\nBenign essential tremor is a type of rhythmic oscillatory movement that occurs with posturing and action. The pathophysiology of this disorder is unclear; however, it classically gets worse with actions that require terminal positioning of the extremities such as pouring a drink or pointing a television remote. The tremor improves with alcohol consumption so patients will often self-medicate with alcoholic drinks. There is a strong genetic component, with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. The best method of replicating the tremor is with the finger-nose-finger test because this requires the patient to perform a precise activity at a terminal distance. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment is with propranolol or primidone, which are both considered first-line agents although the latter has less evidence for its efficacy.\n\nPaparella et al. studied the effects of propranolol on head and upper extremity movements in patients with benign essential tremors. They found that this medication has no effect on head movements but reduces the number of upper extremity tremors in these patients. They recommended that agents other than propranolol should be used for the treatment of head tremors in these patients.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Alcoholics anonymous is the first-line treatment for patients with alcohol use disorder; however, the tremors that occur during alcohol withdrawal are not isolated to movements during terminal activities. Alcohol withdrawal also presents with other signs including restlessness, diaphoresis, and insomnia. More severe cases can present with hallucinations and seizures. The response of this patient's tremor to alcohol consumption is typical of patients with benign essential tremor.\n\nAnswer B: Aripiprazole and other atypical antipsychotic medications can be used in patients with Tourette syndrome; however, these patients will present with involuntary tics rather than a tremor that only occurs during a voluntary activity at the terminal range of motion. Moreover, for the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, both motor and phonic tics must be present.\n\nAnswer C: Carbidopa can be used in the treatment of Parkinson disease; however, the tremor associated with this disease classically occurs at rest and is described in character as a \"pill-rolling\" tremor. The other features of Parkinson disease include bradykinesia or akinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.\n\nAnswer D: Phenobarbital can be used in the treatment of Huntington disease; however, the involuntary movements seen in this disease are classically choreiform rather than intention tremor. Huntington disease presents with chorea, psychiatric illness, and depression. There is commonly a strong genetic predisposition, as it is a trinucleotide repeat disorder that exhibits anticipation.\n\nBullet Summary:\nPropranolol can be used in the treatment of patients with benign essential tremor, which presents with an action tremor that is alleviated by alcohol use.", "realidx": 81, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette describing a patient with a specific set of symptoms and medical history.

This is consistent with tropical sprue.\n\nTropical sprue is characterized by chronic diarrhea that occurs after travel to an endemic area. It is thought to be due to a bacterial overgrowth/infection that then damages the intestinal mucosa. Endemic areas include the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and South India. Patients present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal discomfort/cramps, progressive weight loss, and clinical features of malabsorption. Patients with tropical sprue can develop megaloblastic anemia (low hemoglobin and elevated MCV) from a deficiency in folate and vitamin B12 absorption.

In a case-control study, the authors found that prior infectious gastroenteritis increased the risk of tropical sprue. The authors recommend treatment of suspected tropical sprue with oral folic acid replacement.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Celiac disease can present similarly to tropical sprue with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. A small intestine biopsy can similarly show villous atrophy and a lymphocytic infiltrate, as well as crypt hyperplasia. Celiac disease is an immune response to gluten, while symptoms of tropical sprue are not diet-associated. The development of symptoms following significant travel (lasting at least several weeks) to an endemic country should raise suspicion for tropical sprue.\n\nAnswer B: Crohn disease presents with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, skip lesions anywhere from mouth to anus, extraintestinal manifestations, and signs of malabsorption. A biopsy will show transmural inflammation with noncaseating granulomas, giant cells, and aggregates of lymphocytes in the lamina propria.\n\nAnswer C: Giardia is a parasite that is endemic in the tropics and North American mountain regions. Patients present with foul-smelling diarrhea, excessive gas, and nausea. Diagnosis can be confirmed with a stool analysis or immunoassay. Though a biopsy is normally not indicated, it would show mild lymphocytic infiltration and Giardia trophozoites on the intestinal surface.\n\nAnswer E: Whipple disease is caused by the bacteria Tropheryma whipplei.

Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below. Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL Hematocrit: 30% Leukocyte count: 6,100/mm^3 with normal differential Platelet count: 187,500/mm^3 Serum: Na+: 130 mEq/L Cl-: 100 mEq/L K+: 2.3 mEq/L HCO3-: 28 mEq/L BUN: 40 mg/dL Glucose: 79 mg/dL Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL Ca2+: 8.2 mg/dL Mg2+: 1.8 mg/dL Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): 4.0 mIU/L Free T4: 0.4 ng/dL (normal: 0.7-1.53 ng/dL) The patient is given 4 liters of lactated ringer solution and 40 mEq of potassium.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology for this patient\u2019s chief concern?", "answer": "Hypomagnesemia", "options": {"A": "Hypocalcemia", "B": "Hypomagnesemia", "C": "Hyponatremia", "D": "Hypothyroidism", "E": "Hypovolemia"}, "answer_idx": "B", "reason": "This patient is presenting with what appears to be anorexia nervosa (thin habitus, possible excessive exercise in the setting of marathon running, thinning hair, dry mucous membranes, decreased free T4 level, and multiple electrolyte derangements). The lack of improvement in either her muscle spasms with fluid repletion or her hypokalemia with adequate repletion, even in the setting of normal serum magnesium, suggests depleted magnesium stores are the underlying etiology of her symptoms.\n\nHypomagnesemia typically occurs in alcoholics, malnourished patients, and patients with eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Patients may present with a wide array of symptoms including weakness, confusion, dysrhythmias, hypotension, and overall malaise. Hypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone secretion. Another pathognomonic finding associated with hypomagnesemia is hypokalemia which is refractory to repletion. The pathophysiology is thought to be due to increased potassium wasting in the kidney due to increased activity of renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channels. The serum magnesium level should be checked and repletion should occur accordingly. Serum magnesium levels represent 1% or less of total body magnesium stores and do not reflect if a patient truly has hypomagnesemia, particularly if there is intracellular depletion (such as in chronically malnourished patients). Thus, any patient with findings consistent with hypomagnesemia with normal serum magnesium should have their other electrolytes repleted and be given magnesium. Magnesium repletion is a safe intervention with a wide therapeutic index, and the serum level often does not correlate with total body stores.\n\nRazzaque discusses the relationship between serum magnesium levels and total body magnesium status. The author finds that inadequate magnesium balance is associated with myriad disorders including skeletal deformities, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. The author recommends the use of the magnesium loading test to provide more accurate reflections of total body magnesium status.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Hypocalcemia may present with perioral numbness, paresthesias, and muscle spasms. It can occur secondary to poor nutrition, vitamin D deficiency, and hypoparathyroidism. Low serum calcium may also be seen in patients with low albumin and in states of hyperventilation (which lowers the free calcium but not the total calcium due to a respiratory alkalosis that causes albumin to bind free calcium and release protons). Hypomagnesemia can also cause hypocalcemia as magnesium is needed for proper parathyroid hormone release.\n\nAnswer C: Hyponatremia may present with malaise, nausea, vomiting, headache, and confusion. Patients may also be asymptomatic in mild cases. Asymptomatic patients with hyponatremia and functioning kidneys require only fluid restriction. On the other hand, severe hyponatremia presents with very low sodium (often < 120 mEq/L) and neurological symptoms such as profound confusion or seizures. Treatment with hypertonic saline would be indicated in this situation.\n\nAnswer D: Hypothyroidism presents with fatigue, malaise, weight gain, bradycardia, scarce lanugo, and depression. This patient\u2019s TSH is on the high end of normal and her T4 is lower than the cutoff value. However, this is likely a compensatory response to her low BMI and excessive exercise in order to slow down her metabolism to conserve energy.\n\nAnswer E: Hypovolemia was certainly present in this patient given her dry mucous membranes and prerenal pattern of labs (BUN:Cr ratio > 20:1). After receiving 4L of fluids, it is clear that dehydration is not the cause of her symptoms as her BUN corrects and her symptoms persist. In general, hypovolemia should be treated with oral rehydration, if possible.\n\nBullet Summary:\nHypomagnesemia can cause hypocalcemia and hypokalemia refractory to repletion (a normal serum level does not indicate normal intracellular levels of magnesium).", "realidx": 83, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical vignette that provides a detailed description of a patient's symptoms, medical history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.

At this gestational age, the most definitive method for determining whether such an aneuploidy is present is chorionic villus sampling (CVS).\n\nCVS, or sampling of the placental tissue, can be performed as early as 10 weeks gestation. This is in contrast to amniocentesis, which should be avoided prior to 14 weeks. There are other screening tests for a patient concerned about aneuploidy; however, only CVS and amniocentesis offer definitive diagnoses. Complications of this procedure include pregnancy loss (at a rate of 1-2%), transverse limb abnormality, rupture of membranes, and chorioamnionitis. Patients should also have counseling if genetic abnormalities are detected using this procedure.\n\nFarina reviews the evidence regarding the complications associated with CVS. He discusses how this procedure is becoming more common as the definitive method of providing an early diagnosis. He recommends being aware of complications such as possible pregnancy loss.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Amniocentesis is a useful tool for the definitive diagnosis of aneuploidy and other genetic conditions. Due to the higher rate of fetal loss at younger gestational ages, it is reserved for those above 14 weeks.\n\nAnswer B: The anatomy ultrasound can be helpful in identifying morphologic features that are concerning for Down syndrome, such as a flat nasal bridge or an echogenic cardiac focus.

{"question": "A 4-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last 2 days. Her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation via an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and was discharged home after 2 days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a confirmatory test of cure. The biological father is no longer involved in the patient's life, but her mother\u2019s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. The neonate\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 56/35 mmHg, pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin.

His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, and respirations are 12/min on a ventilator. His Glasgow coma score (GCS) on presentation is 6.

Cortical and brain stem function must be absent in brain death; however, spinal cord reflexes such as triple flexion (flexion of the thigh, leg, and foot upon noxious stimulation of the foot) may remain intact in patients with brain death.\n\nThe clinical brain death exam may be performed in patients with evidence of irreversible central nervous system catastrophe after a known mechanism of trauma or medical injury. The patient must not have other causes for obtundation, and should be euthermic, not on sedative or paralytic agents, not be intoxicated due to drugs or poisoning, and not have other severe electrolyte, acid-base, or endocrine disturbances. In brain death, there must be no cerebral motor response such as moaning or grimacing to pain in all extremities and the face. Brain stem reflexes such as the pupillary light reflex, corneal reflex, oculocephalic reflex, vestibulo-ocular reflex, gag reflex, and apnea test should also be absent in brain death. Spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may still be present in brain death. Complex movements mediated by the spinal cord such as triple flexion and the Lazarus sign (raising the arms and dropping them crossed on the chest after noxious stimulus) do not preclude a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nGreer et al. review neurologic criteria for the determination of brain death. They discuss how to clinically differentiate spinal motor responses from brain-mediated motor responses. They recommend understanding these distinctions in order to properly examine patients with brain death.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Blinking after saline is applied to the cornea indicates a positive corneal reflex. In the corneal reflex, the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal (V1) nerve senses stimulus to the cornea, and bilateral temporal branches of the facial nerve (VII) activate the orbicularis oculi muscles to blink. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of a corneal reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer B: Conjugate eye movement to the left with rotation of the head to the right describes the oculocephalic reflex. In this reflex, movement of the head stimulates endolymph in the horizontal semicircular canal to rotate, causing the firing of the ipsilateral vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerve. This leads to activation or inhibition of the contralateral abducens (VI) and oculomotor (III) nerves. Brainstem reflexes must be absent in brain death, so the presence of an oculocephalic reflex is not compatible with a diagnosis of brain death.\n\nAnswer D: Grimacing after the noxious stimulus of the arm indicates some residual cortical function. Grimacing is not a spinal cord reflex and requires some cortical processing of sensory information. All cortical function must be absent in brain death, so grimacing to pain would not be compatible with brain death.\n\nAnswer E: Spontaneous respiration 1 minute after disconnection from a ventilator in a patient without diabetes insipidus and with normal blood gas values and systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg indicates a negative apnea test. The apnea test assesses respiratory control system reflexes in the brainstem. Apnea testing is an important component of the brain death exam, and a negative apnea test is incompatible with brain death.\n\nBullet Summary:\nAlthough brain death criteria universally include the absence of cortical and brainstem function, spinal cord and deep tendon reflexes may be preserved in patients with brain death.", "realidx": 102, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presented is a clinical scenario involving a patient who has been in a motor vehicle accident and is now being evaluated for brain death.

{"question": "A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with epistaxis for the past hour.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?", "answer": "Topical oxymetazoline", "options": {"A": "Cauterization with silver nitrate", "B": "Fresh frozen plasma and intravenous phytonadione", "C": "Intravenous tranexamic acid", "D": "Placement of posterior nasal packing", "E": "Topical oxymetazoline"}, "answer_idx": "E", "reason": "This patient on warfarin is presenting with epistaxis from the anterior nares (and is currently hemodynamically stable) suggesting anterior epistaxis. Prior to more invasive measures, topical therapy with oxymetazoline should be tried as it is very successful in reducing or resolving epistaxis.\n\nEpistaxis can be a benign or life-threatening presentation. For anterior epistaxis, the management is centered on compression of the anterior nares as most cases are caused by bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus. If this fails, the next step in management is having the patient blow their nose to remove any clots, followed by vigorous application of topical oxymetazoline which vasoconstricts the vessels in the nares and is highly effective in treating epistaxis. If this fails, other topical agents include topical tranexamic acid, and thrombogenic foams. If pressure and topical therapy fail to resolve epistaxis, then anterior nasal packing (such as nasal tampons) may be used.\n\nKucik and Clenney review treatments for epistaxis. They note that the first-line treatment of anterior epistaxis is compression of the anterior nares. If this fails, they recommend other measures such as topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, and packing.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Cauterization with silver nitrate is appropriate for anterior epistaxis, but generally should be reserved for patients who have failed initial medical therapy with topical agents. It may also be appropriate first-line therapy in patients with recurrent epistaxis from a clear, single bleeding vessel (which is not present in this patient).\n\nAnswer B: Fresh frozen plasma and intravenous phytonadione is the appropriate reversal agent for warfarin. While this may stop the patient's epistaxis, he is hemodynamically stable and the bleeding is not life-threatening; thus, the risk of thrombus from atrial fibrillation is likely greater than the risk of bleeding in this case of epistaxis. Less invasive medical therapy should be started/tried first.\n\nAnswer C: Intravenous tranexamic acid would be appropriate in an acutely hemorrhaging patient to reduce bleeding in the setting of hemorrhagic shock. Topical (not intravenous) tranexamic acid may be an appropriate first-line agent for anterior epistaxis.\n\nAnswer D: Placement of posterior nasal packing would be indicated if there was persistent bleeding in the setting of posterior epistaxis (often from bleeding from the sphenopalatine artery), which presents with more profuse bleeding that may threaten the airway. This patient's bleeding is clearly anterior as it can easily be visualized in the anterior nares; thus, this intervention is not needed.\n\nBullet Summary:\nTopical oxymetazoline and other topical agents such as tranexamic acid are appropriate first-line agents in the management of epistaxis if pressure alone fails to resolve symptoms.", "realidx": 103, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a patient with epistaxis and provides a detailed description of the patient's medical history, current medications, vital signs, and physical examination findings.

It has multiple etiologies, including disc herniation, epidural abscess, tumor, or lumbar spine spondylosis. Cauda equina syndrome presents with severe low back pain radiating into the legs, flaccid paralysis or lower extremity weakness which can be symmetric or asymmetric (often asymmetric), bladder and/or rectal sphincter paralysis, impotence/erectile dysfunction, sensory loss in affected dermatomes, and saddle anesthesia (sensory loss in the perineum). Urinary retention occurs due to bladder paralysis. Diagnosis is aided by emergency magnetic resonance imaging. Cauda equina syndrome is a surgical emergency; the goal of surgical treatment is to decompress the cauda equina to prevent permanent neurological injury, such as with a lumbar laminectomy. This can be differentiated from conus medullaris syndrome, which has perianal numbness without numbness through other dermatomes (down the leg in the S1 or S2 patterns), less severe pain (cauda equina presents with more severe pain), and hyperreflexia in the knees (cauda equina presents with lower motor neuron signs in the legs which lead to decreased reflexes - though conus medullaris may present with absent ankle reflexes, the knees are typically hyperreflexic).\n\nGardner et al. review the symptoms, diagnosis, and medico-legal landscape of cauda equina syndrome.

The patient should have a radiograph of the hand and wrist to evaluate for discrepancies between bone age and chronological age.\n\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as the absence or incomplete development of secondary sexual characteristics (increased testicular volume and pubic hair) at 14 years or older. It has a variety of etiologies including chromosomal abnormalities, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiencies, and constitutional delay of puberty. In addition to obtaining a history and physical examination, initial diagnostic studies used to work up delayed puberty includes a radiograph of the hand and wrist to determine bone age, and serum studies (complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, follicular-stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], and testosterone). Radiography can compare the patient's bone age to the chronological age (as constitutional delay presents with delayed bone age), and serum endocrine studies can help distinguish between primary causes of hypogonadism (high FSH and LH) and secondary causes of hypogonadism (low to normal FSH and LH). Treatment in cases with a specific cause of delayed puberty is aimed at the underlying cause. For male patients with presumed constitutional delay of puberty, therapy can include hormone replacement with testosterone.\n\nSaengkaew et al. discuss the genetics of pubertal delay. The authors find that pathologic mechanisms that may underlie constitutional delay of puberty are largely related to GnRH neuronal development and biology. The authors recommend further study of GnRH neuronal biology and network functionality to provide the opportunity for improved therapies for patients with disorders of puberty.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Karyotyping is a useful diagnostic study in patients with Klinefelter syndrome, which would demonstrate 47, XXY.

These symptoms would suggest that the patient has a prolactinoma causing impingement of the optic chiasm leading to bitemporal hemianopsia and sometimes a headache. Laboratory studies consistent with a prolactinoma include elevated serum prolactin with low to normal FSH and TSH.\n\nAnswer C: Reassurance with close follow-up would be appropriate in some patients with constitutional delay of puberty, which is the most common cause of delayed puberty. It is believed to be caused by a transient defect in the production of GnRH. Patients typically have a family history of \"late bloomers,\" characterized as family members having a late growth spurt or late puberty.\n\nAnswer E: Testicular ultrasound would be appropriate in patients with asymmetric testicles since gonadal tumors can occur in a number of intersex disorders (e.g., androgen insensitivity syndrome) and present with impaired sexual maturation.\n\nBuller Summary:\nDelayed puberty in boys is defined as a lack of testicular enlargement by age 14 and initial diagnostic evaluation should include radiography of the hand and wrist as well as serum testing (FSH, LH, and testosterone).", "realidx": 117, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 16-year-old boy with concerns about delayed puberty and short stature.

Poor glycemic control increases the risk of a neural tube defect in the fetus.\n\nInfants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are at increased risk of many congenital malformations as well as postnatal complications. These risks are more likely if there is poor maternal glycemic control, especially in the periconceptional period. Poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c and microalbuminuria on urinalysis indicate long-standing poor glycemic control and indicate a poor prognosis. The most common anomalies in IDM are cardiovascular defects such as septal defects and transposition of the great arteries as well as neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Sacral agenesis, or a poorly developed caudal spine and spinal cord, as well as small left colon syndrome due to a meconium plug, are other common malformations seen in IDM. General complications in IDM include prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia, and miscarriage. Risk is minimized by tight glycemic control throughout pregnancy.\n\nDean et al. summarize the evidence surrounding micronutrients and obesity in pregnancy. They found that patients with diabetes had a higher risk of having infants with a neural tube or a congenital heart defect. They recommend using folic acid supplementation in all patients to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Aneuoploidy risk is not increased in IDM. This complication is associated with advanced maternal age. This patient is at baseline risk since she is below the \u201cadvanced maternal age\u201d cutoff of 35 years. Some of the values used in aneuploidy screening (maternal serum alpha\u00adfetoprotein, estriol, and inhibin A) are generally lower in women with diabetes. Guidelines specific to this patient population should be used for the aneuploidy screen so as to avoid false positive results.\n\nAnswer B: Neonatal hyperglycemia is not seen in IDM. Patients may experience hypoglycemia. This is due to the crossing of glucose from the mother to the fetus via the placenta and subsequent hyperinsulinemia and \u00df-cell hyperplasia from the fetus. After delivery, the high insulin levels cause hypoglycemia because there is no longer an overabundant source of glucose. Hyperglycemia in infants is much less common and can be due to glucose infusion or sepsis.\n\nAnswer D: Oligohydramnios is not specifically associated with maternal hyperglycemia. Instead, patients may experience polyhydramnios. The mechanism for increased amniotic fluid is unclear, though some speculate that fetal hyperglycemia results in polyuria and thus polyhydramnios. Severe oligohydramnios can cause pulmonary hypoplasia and clubfoot as well as cord compression, while polyhydramnios is associated with cord prolapse, placental abruption, and prematurity.\n\nAnswer E: Post-term delivery occurs after 42 weeks gestation. Maternal diabetes typically causes prematurity. Post-term delivery is associated with fetal malnutrition, hypoxemia, and oligohydramnios due to suboptimal functioning of the placenta. The risk of meconium aspiration increases as gestational age increases.

Compression of the nerve leads to symptoms along the plantar surface of the foot which can include pain, tingling, or numbness. These symptoms can be exacerbated/triggered by tapping on the tunnel, which lies posterior to the medial malleolus. In addition, the symptoms can occur at rest or during activity and are not improved with rest. Treatment is rest, NSAIDs, properly fitted shoes/orthotics, and in refractory cases, surgical release of the tarsal tunnel.\n\nGould reviews the evidence regarding the diagnosis and treatment of tarsal tunnel syndrome. He discusses how this syndrome represents a collection of different entities including space-filling lesions and local inflammation. He recommends definitive diagnosis prior to surgical treatment given that the syndrome is often misdiagnosed.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Common fibular nerve compression typically occurs when there is trauma/compression just inferior to the head of the fibula. This can occur when an individual wears work boots and after fractures of the fibular neck. Symptoms of common fibular nerve compression include foot drop and numbness on the dorsum of the foot. Treatment is with activity modification and a foot orthosis to prevent an equinus contracture.\n\nAnswer B: Herniated disc presents with symptoms of radiculopathy including pain that travels down the leg through the toes. Symptoms are worsened with flexion of the leg such as during the straight leg raise test. Treatment is with NSAIDs and corticosteroid injections with surgical decompression of the disc in refractory cases.\n\nAnswer C: Plantar fasciitis can present very similarly to tarsal tunnel syndrome with pain along the plantar surface of the foot. The pain is typically exacerbated by activity and improves with rest in contrast to this patient. In addition, there is an absence of burning, pain, and numbness that occur in tarsal tunnel syndrome. Tenderness will be at the medial insertion of the plantar fascia into the calcaneal tuberosity.

On physical exam, he is found to have an intact motor and sensory function in his lower extremities bilaterally. No clonus or Babinski sign is appreciated. An exam of the cranial nerves is intact bilaterally.

The straight leg test can help confirm the diagnosis.\n\nA herniated disc classically presents in a middle-aged or older individual who was lifting a heavy object with improper form. They will typically experience lower back pain that can be described as radicular. The pain will typically travel down the legs or \"shoot down\" the legs and is typically described as feeling electrical. The straight leg test on physical exam supports the diagnosis without an MRI. When the individual raises their leg, this causes compression of the spinal nerve roots leading to an exacerbation of symptoms. The most appropriate initial step in management for these patients is limiting strenuous activity, physical therapy, and NSAIDs. Patients who have chronic symptoms that have failed conservative management can undergo surgical laminectomy.\n\nCamino and Piuzzi present the data regarding the diagnostic value of the straight leg raise test. They discuss how this test can exacerbate patients with radicular symptoms. They recommend all practitioners learn how to perform and interpret this test.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh is referred to as the FABER test and is used to evaluate for sacroiliitis which can present with lower back pain and pain in the buttocks. This exam maneuver will cause intense pain in patients who have inflammation of the joint. Treatment is with physical therapy and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer B: Internal rotation of the extended hip is the Freiberg test which evaluates for piriformis syndrome. Piriformis syndrome presents with lower back pain similar to a herniated disc; however, is less likely to have occurred after a single lifting episode and does not typically present with electrical pain that originates in the buttocks.\n\nAnswer C: Palpating the paraspinal muscles is a non-specific test that could further support a diagnosis of a muscle strain. It will likely not provide much information in the diagnosis of a herniated disc. Patients with muscle strain can be treated conservatively with relative rest and NSAIDs.\n\nAnswer D: Radiography is unlikely to offer information regarding this patient's herniated disc.

It initially presents with a vague constellation of symptoms including fatigue, fevers, easy bleeding/bruising, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and possibly testicular enlargement. The diagnosis is supported when the white blood cell count (which can be low, normal, or high) demonstrates increased lymphoblasts. Further confirmatory testing may include testing for the 12:21 translocation, which is more common with a better prognosis, or the 9:22 translocation (the Philadelphia chromosome), which is less common and denotes a poor prognosis.\n\nOnciu reviews ALL. He notes that ALL has a high cure rate with intensive chemotherapeutic regimens and that new research is improving outcomes in this very common condition. He recommends early treatment with these regimens for an improved prognosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a malignancy of myeloblasts and is more common in the elderly. Patients will present with systemic symptoms, weight loss, anorexia, leukocytosis, anemia (causing fatigue), thrombocytopenia (causing bleeding including gingival bleeding and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract), and neutropenia (predisposing patients to life-threatening infection). Myeloblasts produce increased amounts of myeloperoxidase which can lead to the formation of Auer rods that can be seen on peripheral smear.\n\nAnswer C: Chronic myelogenous leukemia is a neoplastic proliferation of myeloid stem cells and presents with a leukocyte count > 50,000/mm3. There are different presentations for this condition. Most patients present in the chronic phase with minimal symptoms (and a low blast count); however, they can also present with an accelerated phase and a blast phase which can lead to a hematologic emergency termed a blast crisis which may cause a hyperviscosity syndrome.\n\nAnswer D: Leukemoid reaction is an overly robust immune reaction (often to infection) that resembles chronic myelogenous leukemia.

She denies dysuria, vaginal discharge, or vaginal pruritus. The patient has never been pregnant and previously used a copper intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception, but she had the IUD removed 1 year ago because it worsened her menorrhagia.

Primary adrenal insufficiency is due to dysfunction at the level of the adrenal glands themselves, as opposed to upstream factors such as the pituitary gland. Primary adrenal insufficiency in developed nations is most often caused by autoimmune disease. In developing nations, adrenal tuberculosis is a significant cause of primary adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal tuberculosis often presents with a history of tuberculosis or tuberculosis symptoms, as well as symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and hyperpigmentation. Patients often have hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, low morning cortisol, a failed cosyntropin test, and high ACTH concentrations. Radiography may demonstrate bilateral adrenal calcifications, and/or adrenal enlargement.

Additionally, this patient has signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia), and patients often require mineralocorticoid therapy or a high dose of a glucocorticoid with mineralocorticoid activity (e.g., hydrocortisone). Dexamethasone has minimal to absent mineralocorticoid activity.\n\nAnswer C: Hydrocortisone therapy and immunoglobulin therapy are incorrect because this patient has adrenal tuberculosis.

The most appropriate initial management for patients in ADHF is a loop diuretic such as furosemide.\n\nHeart failure (HF) is a condition in which the heart does not pump effectively and can be due to either difficulty with relaxation in diastole or contraction in systole or a combination of both. Risk factors for this condition include myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, valvular disease, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Left-sided HF leads to decreased forward flow into the systemic circulation and increased congestion in the pulmonary circulation which clinically manifests as shortness of breath, pulmonary edema, and crackles on lung exam. Early pulmonary edema leads to a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch which causes hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate, which leads to hypocapnia and respiratory alkalosis.

{"question": "A 2-year-old girl presents to the pediatrician with her mother for a routine well-child visit. Her mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and refuses to eat vegetables. She drinks milk with meals and has juice sparingly. She goes to sleep easily at night and usually sleeps for 11-12 hours. The patient has trouble falling asleep for naps but does nap for 1-2 hours a few times per week. She is doing well in daycare and enjoys parallel play with the other children.

He should undergo monofilament testing to assess the subsequent risk of developing foot ulcers.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is the most common underlying cause of diabetic foot ulcers. The pathophysiology of diabetic foot ulcers is thought to be the loss of pain and pressure sensation, which leads to muscular imbalance and foot deformities. This subsequently decreases microcirculation and impairs the integrity of the skin, leading to the formation of foot ulcers. Diabetic foot ulcers, like other neuropathic ulcers, occur commonly under bony prominences in the foot. During monofilament testing, a 10-g monofilament is placed on the plantar surface of the foot at a right angle, and pressure is applied until the patient can no longer tolerate it or the filament buckles. Patients with diabetic neuropathy have a higher-pressure threshold due to loss of sensation, and this is a useful predictor of the severity of diabetic neuropathy and future foot ulcer formation. The management of diabetic neuropathy consists of tight glycemic control, weight loss, blood pressure control, exercise, preventing complications, and pain management with pharmacotherapy (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or gabapentinoid antiseizure medications).\n\nTesfaye et al. study the efficacy of various first-line medications for diabetic nephropathy including amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, or gabapentin. The authors found that there were no differences between any of the medications as monotherapy. The authors recommended adding combination pharmacotherapy for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy that do not respond to initial monotherapy.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Ankle-brachial index is a calculation made in the assessment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). While PAD can present with arterial ulcers, these are usually located at the tip of the toes and not the plantar surface. Furthermore, the ankle-brachial index does not accurately assess small vessel disease, which is associated with diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nAnswer B: Capillary refill time, when delayed, may suggest decreased limb perfusion. This is a nonspecific test, as decreased limb perfusion can be caused by peripheral arterial disease, volume depletion, or hypotension.\n\nAnswer C: Contrast-enhanced foot MRI is the most sensitive and specific test to identify soft tissue complications of acute osteomyelitis. This patient has no clinical features of osteomyelitis (fever, chills, or malaise, ulcer that probes to bone) and does not require imaging currently.\n\nAnswer D: Knee reflex testing is not useful in assessing diabetic neuropathy.

In the setting of his normal head CT, aspirin should be administered next.\n\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief episode of focal neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves without any residual deficits. Patients with a TIA are at high risk for future TIAs and stroke. For this reason, management is immediately centered on a thorough neurological exam followed by a CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhage. Subsequently, aspirin should immediately be administered which reduces the incidence of future stroke. Patients will subsequently be discharged on aspirin in addition to other morbidity-lowering agents including a statin and tight blood pressure and glycemic control as well as a second antiplatelet agent in appropriate patients. Further workup for a TIA may include a CTA head/neck, an MRI brain, and an echocardiogram. Modification of risk factors is also critical in these patients including weight loss, smoking cessation, exercise, glycemic control, and blood pressure control.\n\nClissold et al. review transient ischemic attacks. They note that transient ischemic attacks (TIA), if untreated, carry a high risk of early subsequent stroke. They recommend, after appropriate diagnostic workup, early administration of an antiplatelet agent.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Atorvastatin is an important initial intervention in the management of patients who have TIA/stroke. However, this intervention takes weeks of consistent therapy in order to have a significant effect on morbidity, thus it would not be the most important next step in management when compared to aspirin, which is more important in reducing acute stroke risk. Further, a lipid panel is generally performed first to determine if a statin is needed.\n\nAnswer C: CTA head/neck is a part of the workup of a TIA to rule out carotid stenosis/dissection/atherosclerosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is more important to give aspirin early in TIA/stroke prior to obtaining further imaging (though this study would still be performed).\n\nAnswer D: Labetalol and other blood pressure medications are important in risk factor modification to prevent future strokes/TIAs. Patients with diabetic nephropathy should be on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker which are nephroprotective.

The majority of cases of cephalohematoma self-resolve, thus the most appropriate next step in management is observation.\n\nA cephalohematoma is a relatively common traumatic birth injury that occurs after prolonged labor or instrumentation due to rupture of the periosteal bridging veins. Because bleeding through these veins is slow, they typically present several hours after birth with a fluctuant swelling of the scalp that is limited by suture lines.

With rapid and proper transport of the patient and appendage, successful reattachment could be possible pending a surgical evaluation. It is important to know how to appropriately package the severed digit so as to optimize tissue viability. Cooling with ice water can slow the metabolic rate of the tissue and result in less tissue damage; however, there is a delicate balance. There must be proper barriers between the digit and ice water to avoid ice burns which could compromise the tissue.

{"question": "A 77-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a complaint of sudden onset weakness in his right upper extremity. At home, the patient thought he was simply dehydrated, but he rapidly began to have trouble speaking. When his wife noted this she brought him into the hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, the patient is not responding to verbal stimuli and only withdraws his left upper extremity and lower extremity to pain. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and atrial fibrillation treated with metoprolol, apixaban, and lisinopril. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 170/100 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has a seizure and subsequently demonstrates agonal breathing. He no longer responds to painful stimuli. A fingerstick blood glucose is 122 mg/dL.

Initially, his symptoms are in his right upper extremity, which then progresses to affect his speech and cause altered mental status, obtundation, and seizures, which is suggestive of a left-sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.\n\nIntraparenchymal (IPH) cerebral hemorrhages often present with sudden-onset focal neurologic deficits. A unique feature is that IPHs tend to present with progressive/worsening symptoms in contrast to ischemic strokes which often demonstrate stable or improving symptoms. It is not uncommon for a patient to present with focal neurologic deficits, which then progress to seizures and obtundation. Risk factors include older age, hypertension, and blood thinners. The prognosis is poor in intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and outcomes are dependent on the size and location of the bleed. Initial workup should be centered on obtaining a fingerstick blood glucose, securing the airway, and obtaining CNS imaging (often with a non-contrast CT scan). Further management is centered on elevating the head of the bed, reversing the patient's anticoagulation status, and possible neurosurgical intervention (though prognosis is very poor in general).\n\nGross et al. review IPH. They note that IPH has very high morbidity and mortality even when treated. There is ongoing research into minimally invasive approaches for evacuation of primary IPH to optimize and improve outcomes, although immediate medical therapy is needed to reduce mortality which is recommended.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Epidural hematomas present after trauma with the \"talk and die\" syndrome beginning with a period of unconsciousness, a lucid interval, and then progressive obtundation. A CT of the head would demonstrate a lens-shaped lesion, and a burr hole to drain the collection of blood is the treatment of choice. Acute epidural hematomas do not typically begin spontaneously.\n\nAnswer C: Ischemic strokes present with sudden onset, focal neurologic deficits. Generally, after the initial ischemic event, patients will be stable or even note an improvement in their symptoms. It is less likely that this patient's progressive symptoms and seizures are caused by an ischemic stroke when compared to a hemorrhagic stroke or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This diagnosis is certainly possible, and further workup with CT imaging and possibly MRI is needed to clarify the diagnosis and direct further care.\n\nAnswer D: Subarachnoid hemorrhages generally present with a \"thunderclap\" headache with meningeal signs. It is possible that patients may present with obtundation and confusion with severe subarachnoid hemorrhages. Seizures are uncommon in subarachnoid hemorrhages and generally do not present with such focal neurologic deficits. CT will show blood in the subarachnoid space. The diagnosis can be supported with CTA or a lumbar puncture. Further management may involve nimodipine, neurosurgical intervention, and observation if the bleed is small and has stopped on its own.\n\nAnswer E: Subdural hematomas are more common in the elderly patients and patients with alcohol use disorder and present after trauma with a gradual progression of altered mental status to obtundation. Note that large subdural hematomas may present with a rapid progression of symptoms. CT of the head will demonstrate a crescent-shaped lesion that crosses suture lines.

He discusses how natural levels of melatonin decrease in aging animals, which may have implications on the circadian clock. He recommends studies on whether melatonin supplementation may be beneficial to mitigate the effects of aging.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Decreased orexin levels would be seen in patients with narcolepsy, which presents with sudden episodes of falling asleep. This tends to occur in younger patients and is also associated with cataplexy or sudden loss in muscle tone. Treatment of this disorder is with stimulant medications such as modafinil.\n\nAnswer C: Increased acetylcholine levels would not be seen in patients as they age and would not explain the changes this patient is experiencing. Rather, acetylcholine levels tend to decline as we age. Drinking caffeinated drinks is associated with increased acetylcholine levels in the brain.\n\nAnswer D: Increased dopamine would not be a principle change seen in age-related sleep changes. Higher dopamine levels would increase feelings of being awake as well as alertness. In contrast, decreased dopamine levels can be seen in patients with Parkinson disease, which would present with bradykinesia and a resting tremor.\n\nAnswer E: Increased norepinephrine would result in increased wakefulness and potentially insomnia; however, it would not explain the changes seen in normal aging.

Symptoms include watery or mucoid discharge and eye swelling. The conjunctiva may be especially irritated. Diagnosis can be established by direct antibody testing or PCR. Treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis includes both topical and oral erythromycin as there is likely dissemination of the infection. The most common complication of chlamydial conjunctivitis is pneumonia. Of note, all neonates with gonococcal conjunctivitis should also be treated for chlamydia.\n\nSmith-Norowitz et al. studied whether antibiotic prophylaxis was beneficial compared with silver nitrate for chlamydia conjunctivitis. They found that there was no benefit to topical antibiotic treatment compared with silver nitrate alone. They recommend testing infants for the disease if it is suspected so that oral antibiotics can be administered effectively.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Artificial tears can be used in chemical conjunctivitis. The most common cause of neonatal chemical conjunctivitis is post-delivery silver nitrate drops. It usually presents within the first 24 hours following birth/exposure with mild conjunctival injection and tearing, and will spontaneously resolve within 2-4 days.\n\nAnswer B: Intravenous acyclovir is used to treat conjunctivitis caused by herpes simplex virus.

This in turn leads to decreased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), disruption to estrogen levels, and amenorrhea. A common associated clinical presentation is known as the \"female athlete triad\", which includes decreased calorie availability or increased energy expenditure through exercise, decreased bone mineral density due to a decrease in estrogen levels, and menstrual dysfunction. Treatment includes increasing caloric intake, behavioral therapy as needed, and possible estrogen replacement therapy.\n\nAckerman et al. reviews the role of estrogen replacement in improving bone mineral density in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The authors find that spine and femoral neck bone mineral density z-scores significantly increased with estrogen replacement. The authors recommend the use of transdermal estradiol over 12 months in improving bone mineral density in patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Anorexia nervosa will often manifest with secondary amenorrhea in women. This patient has a normal BMI and no history of disordered eating. The mechanism of amenorrhea in the setting of anorexia nervosa relates to the same hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis at play in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea wherein the state of energy deficiency from inadequate caloric intake disrupts normal pulsatile GnRH secretion, leading to decreased FSH, LH, estrogen levels, and subsequent amenorrhea.\n\nAnswer C: Hypothyroidism is a cause of secondary amenorrhea wherein abnormal thyroid function can lead to altered levels of sex hormone-binding protein, prolactin, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thus causing menstrual dysfunction. This patient does not present with other signs of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, sensitivity to cold, dry skin, muscle weakness, weight gain, constipation, joint stiffness, or thinning hair.\n\nAnswer D: Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition often associated with obesity in which hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance is hypothesized to alter the hypothalamus feedback response, leading to the increased luteinizing hormone to follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, increased androgen levels, and decreased rate of follicular maturation leading to unruptured follicles. Patients will often present with amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, acne, and decreased fertility.\n\nAnswer E: Pregnancy is a cause of secondary amenorrhea that is less likely in this patient given her lack of sexual history and other associated symptoms such as decreased appetite, nausea, and insomnia.

Patients usually present with back or neck pain, with or without fever, and the most common clinical finding is local tenderness to percussion over the involved posterior spinous process. Risk factors include injection drug use, degenerative spine disease, prior spinal surgery, infective endocarditis, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy, and other immunocompromised states. Vital signs may be normal, and laboratory evaluation commonly reveals an elevated white blood cell count, ESR, and CRP. An MRI of the spine is the most appropriate diagnostic test. In stable patients, antimicrobial therapy should be withheld until a microbiological diagnosis is confirmed; once the diagnosis is confirmed, pathogen-directed therapy should then be administered.\n\nBeronius et al. conducted a retrospective study on vertebral osteomyelitis in pursuit of diagnostic criteria to simplify the diagnosis and classification of vertebral osteomyelitis.

It typically does not result in radiculopathy, defined as irritation or injury of a nerve root, causing pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling in specific distributions depending on the location of the affected nerve root. Though it is certainly on the differential for this patient, his elevated ESR and CRP make osteomyelitis a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Herniated disc can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the position and size of the herniation.

The most appropriate next step in management is a fine needle aspiration (FNA).\n\nThe first step in the diagnostic work-up of a thyroid nodule, which can be found incidentally in asymptomatic individuals or in the presence of obstructive or vocal symptoms, includes an ultrasound and measurement of serum TSH levels. If TSH is normal or elevated, this suggests a hypofunctioning (\u201ccold\u201d) nodule, which increases the risk of cancer. These nodules should undergo FNA if suspicious sonographic findings are present. Suspicious sonographic findings include irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, and rim calcifications in nodules \u2265 1 cm in diameter. If TSH is low, then thyroid scintigraphy (radioiodine scan) should be performed to confirm whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning (\u201chot\u201d). Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely cancerous, so these patients can often avoid FNA. Hyperfunctioning nodules such as toxic adenomas which cause overt hyperthyroid symptoms may warrant further treatment with radioiodine, surgery, or anti-thyroid medications.\n\nDurante et al. review the epidemiology and diagnostic approach to thyroid nodules. The authors find that nodules with suspicious sonographic patterns such as solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications should undergo cytological evaluation.

Although a hypofunctioning nodule is more likely to be malignant, an FNA should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer E: Thyroid scintigraphy is used for thyroid nodules with low TSH, which increases the probability of a hyperfunctioning nodule. Confirmation of a hyperfunctioning nodule can help prevent further invasive diagnostic work-up because hyperfunctioning nodules are unlikely to be malignant.

Sleep hygiene includes discussing the patient\u2019s exposure to light (eliminate exposure to blue light at night), altering diet (no large meals or caffeine before bed), and behavioral modification (only using the bed for sleep).

It is associated with risk factors such as recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, and advanced age. Diagnosis is established via a positive enzyme immunoassay for C. difficile toxins and C. difficile glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), or a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for C. difficile toxins. The GDH enzyme immunoassay is highly sensitive for detecting C. difficile, but not specific for toxin-producing C. difficile, and thus the toxin enzyme immunoassay is submitted in conjunction. If the results of both are discordant, then NAAT is used to make the diagnosis. Treatment for C. difficile infection differs by disease severity and recurrence. Commonly used medications include fidaxomicin and oral vancomycin.\n\nMcDonald et al. review the guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of C. difficile and provide the algorithm for C. difficile testing as mentioned above. The authors also note that only liquid stool from patients with clinically significant and acute diarrhea should be submitted for testing. The authors recommend that formed stool from asymptomatic patients should not be tested because the presence of the C. difficile toxin gene does not distinguish between infection and asymptomatic carriage.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Abdominal radiograph is an appropriate adjunctive diagnostic tool in patients with severe disease (e.g., severe abdominal pain and distension, fever, hypovolemia, lactic acidosis, marked leukocytosis) or fulminant colitis (marked by hypotension and ileus) to evaluate for toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention. In patients who are stable with low concern for severe disease or fulminant colitis, it would not be the preferred initial test for diagnosis nor would it be confirmatory.\n\nAnswer B: CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast is the preferred modality for detecting the presence of toxic megacolon, bowel perforation, or other findings that warrant surgical intervention in the setting of C. difficile colitis. Colonic dilatation of > 7 cm in diameter in the clinical setting of severe C. difficile infection is diagnostic. Other findings may include small bowel dilatation or scalloping of the bowel wall due to submucosal edema. While it would be reasonable to perform a CT scan in this patient, it would not confirm the diagnosis.\n\nAnswer C: Flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate for cases in which an alternative diagnosis is suspected that requires direct visualization and/or biopsy of the bowel mucosa. It may also be helpful for patients with ileus or colitis in the absence of diarrhea as it allows for visualization of pseudomembranes on the inflamed mucosal surface, which are highly suggestive of C. difficile infection. In general, colonoscopy is a preferred and more accurate test.\n\nAnswer D: Rectal swab for selective anaerobic culture involves culture on a selective medium with toxin testing of isolated C. difficile. It is a highly sensitive test, but culture cannot distinguish toxin-producing strains from non-toxin-producing strains. A second test is required to detect toxin production by the cultured C. difficile strain (either enzyme immunoassay or nucleic acid amplification testing). Culture takes several days to finalize and as such, it is seldom used to establish a clinical diagnosis.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) characterized by prominent irritability and disruption of everyday life.\n\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder is a variant of PMS characterized by recurrent physical and behavioral symptoms that manifest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolve with menstruation. The diagnosis is made by criteria outlined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). To make a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, symptoms such as marked affective lability or marked irritability or anger must be present along with signs such as decreased concentration, hypersomnia or insomnia, and decreased interest in usual activities. These symptoms must cause significant distress or interfere with work, school, or relationships and must present 1 week before the onset of menses and resolve the week following menses. The initial management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder involves a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy and a menstrual diary to prospectively confirm symptoms and their relationship to the menstrual cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Following confirmation of a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, treatment involves lifestyle changes, antidepressant/anxiolytic medications, or hormonal therapies such as oral contraceptive pills (OCPs).\n\nBhatia et al. discuss premenstrual dysphoric disorder. They note that premenstrual dysphoric disorder affects 2-10% of women of reproductive age. They note that serotonin dysregulation may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is anxiety characterized by symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, and irritability lasting > 6 months unrelated to any specific triggers. The topics of anxiety should be unrelated to one another. This patient's anxiety and symptoms are temporally related to her menstrual cycle, making premenstrual dysphoric disorder a more likely diagnosis.\n\nAnswer B: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by depressed mood and at least 5 of 9 \"SIG E CAPS\" symptoms for 2 weeks or longer. These symptoms include sleep disturbance, anhedonia, guilt, loss of energy, loss of concentration, appetite/weight changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidal ideation. Though this patient exhibits some of these symptoms, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is a more likely diagnosis as she exhibits these symptoms temporally related to her menstrual cycle.\n\nAnswer C: Panic disorder is characterized by 4 or more panic attacks (sweating, palpitations, shaking, paresthesias) in a 4-week period or \u2265 1 panic attack followed by at least 1 month of fear of another panic attack. Though this patient experiences anxiety that leads her to avoid her work, she does not have any of the characteristic signs of a panic attack and therefore does not meet the criteria for diagnosis of panic disorder.\n\nAnswer E: PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder have overlap in their symptoms; however, premenstrual dysphoric disorder is characterized by symptoms that significantly affect daily functioning.

His temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 108/64 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, the boy is holding his right wrist with his left hand and cries upon palpation of a region that is 2 cm proximal to his elbow. The radial head is palpated just distal to the lateral epicondyle. He is unable to make a pincer with his right thumb and index finger.

This site is particularly prone to fracture due to the thin bone separating the coronoid and olecranon fossae in the supracondylar region. Due to the proximity of the brachial artery and median nerve, which course anteriorly, these structures are at risk for injury. Neurapraxia of the anterior interosseous nerve, which is a pure motor branch of the median nerve, presents as motor deficits in interphalangeal (IP) joint flexion of the thumb and distal IP joint flexion of the index finger. The radial and ulnar arteries are terminal branches of the brachial artery, which if injured results in diminished distal pulses. The diagnosis is made with anteroposterior and lateral view elbow radiographs. Radiographs will demonstrate the \"fat pad sign\" seen as a posterior fat pad that is indicative of fracture. Management depends on fracture type but can consist of cast immobilization (if minimally displaced with no neurovascular injury) or closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (for more displaced fractures).\n\nMicheloni et al. reviews supracondylar fractures in children. They note it is the most common elbow fracture in the pediatric population. They recommend early and correct diagnosis and management to avoid early and late complications including neurovascular impairment and malunion.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Both bone forearm fracture is another common pediatric fracture sustained from a fall, involving both the radius and ulna.

The first step in management of patients with blunt trauma and hemodynamic instability is a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST exam)\n\nFor any patient with blunt or penetrating trauma, the first step in management is an evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation. This is referred to as the primary survey and includes the verification of endotracheal tube placement, auscultation of bilateral breath sounds, and assessment of external wounds or bleeding. This is followed by the secondary survey which involves a detailed head to toe inspection for injuries. Blunt abdominal trauma with bruising as well as hemodynamic instability warrants a FAST exam. The FAST exam visualizes the heart chambers and pericardium, left upper quadrant (spleen, splenorenal recess), right upper quadrant (Morrison pouch) and the rectovesical (males) or rectouterine (females) pouch. The extended FAST exam (eFAST) includes an examination of the lungs as well to assess for pneumothorax or hemothorax.

Patients with hemodynamic instability and a negative FAST exam should be evaluated for sources of bleeding elsewhere such as the pelvis.\n\nBarloon et al. review diagnostic imaging in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma is a common cause of death and injury, leading to hemodynamic instability.

{"question": "A study is performed that looks at individuals who suffer from opioid use disorder and the effect the disorder has on their daily life and functionality. Individuals are surveyed using a validated method and followed up in 6-month intervals for 5 years. At the end of the study period, 40% of individuals have replied to the survey throughout the entire period. Analyzing only those subjects who responded throughout the entire period, it is determined that opioid use disorder only minimally impairs individuals in their daily functioning. Which of the following most likely occurred in this study?", "answer": "Attrition bias", "options": {"A": "Attrition bias", "B": "Confounding variable", "C": "Late-look bias", "D": "Recall bias", "E": "Volunteer bias"}, "answer_idx": "A", "reason": "This study following individuals who abuse opioids with a 40% follow-up response rate suggests that opioid use disorder (known for impairing daily functioning) has only a minor effect on patient functionality. This is most likely secondary to attrition bias, or a loss to follow-up of participants in a non-random fashion whereby more severe cases stopped responding and were thus left out.\n\nBias in studies distorts outcomes and can make interpreting results challenging. For this reason, it is important to be meticulous when designing a study with every effort to minimize bias. The attrition bias can occur when individuals are lost to follow-up in a non-random fashion. For example, consider the assessment of daily functionality via a validated method in individuals with coronary artery disease. Those who are severely impaired from disease progression may not follow up in this study, thus altering results and removing more severe cases from the analysis. Having a higher response rate can help mitigate this bias, but is more costly as it may be difficult to ensure that every participant follows up.\n\nNunan et al. discuss the attrition bias. They note how it can affect studies and the data collected. They recommend mitigating the attrition bias for more accurate results and clinical application.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer B: Confounding variables are variables that are correlated with the studied variable that better explain the difference between 2 groups. For example, it may be found that alcohol is associated with lung cancer when in reality, the confounding variable of smoking (more common in individuals who drink alcohol) explains this difference.\n\nAnswer C: Late-look bias occurs when patients with severe disease are not studied because they are dead, critically ill, or unavailable to be studied, making the disease overall appear less severe. For example, patients with HIV may not have increased morbidity and mortality in a study. However, this may be a result of all the critically ill cases being too sick or dead and thus unable to participate thus distorting the outcome.\n\nAnswer D: Recall bias occurs when individuals with disease or an adverse outcome are more likely to recall an exposure given the occurred outcome, skewing their memory and thus the results. For example, pregnant mothers who have a newborn with a defect or condition may be more likely to recall certain exposures (such as exposure to pollution).\n\nAnswer E: Volunteer bias occurs when people who volunteer for a study are fundamentally different from the general population or those who do not volunteer.

The most likely diagnosis is a lumbar strain.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of low back pain is broad and includes mechanical causes such as lumbar strain, osteoarthritis, spondylolisthesis, disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and fractures as well as non-mechanical etiologies such as osteomyelitis and malignancy. History and physical should focus on eliciting red flag symptoms, including traumatic etiology, constitutional symptoms (e.g., fever, weight loss), history of malignancy, intravenous drug use, steroid use, and neurological deficits (e.g., saddle anesthesia, incontinence). The presence of any red flags should prompt further evaluation with imaging. Lumbar strain typically presents with acute low back pain after a precipitating event (e.g., lifting weight) with no red flag signs/symptoms and responds well to conservative management including activity modification, ice, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Prevention measures include strengthening of core muscles and education on proper lifting techniques.

They recommend a multimodal interdisciplinary approach to back pain given the many mechanisms, especially in complex cases.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Disc herniation presents with radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots as they exit the spinal canal, manifesting as a burning or shooting pain that radiates down either leg. Dermatomal sensory changes or hyporeflexia may be present depending on the spinal level affected (e.g., reduced Achilles reflex with S1 radiculopathy). The straight leg raise reproduces pain radiating down the leg on the affected side.\n\nAnswer B: Lumbar stenosis characteristically causes low back pain or lower extremity paresthesias with walking or standing that resolves when leaning forward (\u201cshopping cart sign\u201d). This is referred to as neurogenic claudication. Involvement of spinal nerve roots can lead to sensory loss and weakness in the lower extremities.\n\nAnswer D: Osteoarthritis can cause low back pain and stiffness, but is an age-related degenerative disease that is less likely in this patient who presents acutely after activity. The patient also does not have the typical risk factors for osteoarthritis, which include advanced age, female sex, or obesity.\n\nAnswer E: Vertebral compression fracture occurs mainly in osteoporotic patients, whose reduced bone mineral density increases their risk for vertebral body collapse under stress.

For patients in whom an adequate trial of SSRI therapy has been ineffective, the first step in management is a trial of augmentation with a separate agent prior to switching to a different primary antidepressant medication. Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant, acts by inhibiting pre-synaptic alpha-2 receptors as well as 5HT2 and 5HT3 serotonin receptors. Notably, its side effect profile includes increased appetite and mild sleepiness, making it a good option for depressed patients with insomnia or decreased appetite.

Given his history of heavy smoking, lung cancer should be ruled out with a chest CT with possible subsequent bronchoscopy for tissue biopsy.\n\nRecurrent pneumonia can be classified either as those confined to 1 anatomical location of the lung or those involving different portions of the lung. If recurrent pneumonia is limited to a single region, the patient should be evaluated for an anatomic obstruction, such as a mass or mucous plug. Obstruction will hinder mucociliary clearance and allow for the proliferation of bacteria, leading to recurrent infections. The most concerning etiology of such an obstruction is a tumor causing external bronchial compression. Thus, patients should be screened with a chest CT to rule out lung cancer in these cases. If lesions are identified on CT, subsequent bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy may be warranted.

A history of abdominal surgery is a risk factor for SBO due to the formation of adhesions. Patients with SBO can typically be managed conservatively including nasogastric tube suction (if discomfort and active vomiting), bowel rest, and intravenous fluid resuscitation. However, patients with findings of a complicated SBO (changes in abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, guarding, and hemodynamic instability) require emergent surgical intervention.

The most accurate diagnostic test for polymyositis is muscle biopsy.\n\nPolymyositis is caused by an autoimmune reaction that leads to cell-mediated cytotoxicity against unidentified skeletal muscle antigens, primarily affecting the endomysium. It is more often found in women, patients between 30-60 years of age, and African-Americans. Clinical features of polymyositis include symmetric proximal muscle weakness that may be accompanied by myalgia, dysphagia (due to pharyngeal muscle weakness), restrictive lung disease (due to respiratory muscle weakness), cardiac involvement (myocarditis, heart failure), interstitial lung disease, and increased risk of malignancy. There are no accepted diagnostic criteria for polymyositis; however, diagnosis is usually secured with a combination of clinical features and other tests. Routine initial studies can include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, creatine kinase, autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1), and electromyography (EMG). Muscle biopsy of an affected muscle is the gold standard for diagnosis and will typically show muscle fiber damage, CD8+ T cells in the endomysium, and overexpression of MHC-I on the sarcolemma. First-line treatment of polymyositis includes glucocorticoids and a steroid-sparing agent (methotrexate, azathioprine). Subsequent treatments can include intravenous immunoglobulins, rituximab, or plasmapheresis.\n\nAmato et al. review the evaluation and treatment of inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis. They found that polymyositis typically presents in adult life with symmetric proximal leg greater than arm weakness. They recommend that a muscle biopsy be done on any patient considered to have polymyositis, preferably prior to starting immunosuppressive treatment.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Electromyography (EMG) can help distinguish myopathic weakness (e.g., polymyositis) from neuropathic causes of weakness (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myasthenia gravis). Characteristic EMG findings include fibrillations, early recruitment of motor unit potentials, and abnormal low-amplitude motor unit potentials. EMG is not a confirmatory test and is less sensitive than muscle biopsy for diagnosing myositis.\n\nAnswer B: MRI can be used to demonstrate areas of edema, atrophy, fatty replacement, and calcification in patients with suspected polymyositis. MRI can assess large regions of muscle, thus avoiding sampling error with muscle biopsy. The findings in MRI are nonspecific and require correlation with muscle biopsy for definitive diagnosis. MRI can also be used to help select the site of muscle biopsy.\n\nAnswer D: Serum aldolase can occasionally be used in the diagnostic investigation of suspected polymyositis if creatine kinase is normal. Aldolase elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in fasciitis, drug-induced myositis, and connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease.\n\nAnswer E: Serum creatine kinase (CK) is the most sensitive muscle enzyme exam and should be part of the initial diagnostic investigation of any patient with suspected polymyositis. CK elevation is nonspecific and may be seen in myriad conditions such as inflammatory insult, metabolic injury, drug-induced injury, and infection.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMuscle biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of polymyositis.", "realidx": 277, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 53-year-old African-American woman with symptoms suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder.

CJD is usually spontaneous. Rarely, CJD may be familial or acquired (from iatrogenic transmission or dietary exposure). Aggregates of PrPsc lead to spongiform vacuolation. Clinically, this manifests with rapidly progressive mental deterioration with prominent executive dysfunction (declining concentration, judgment, and memory) and startle myoclonus. Further diagnostic investigation may reveal 14-3-3 protein on CSF analysis and synchronous sharp wave complexes on electroencephalogram (EEG). CJD usually leads to death within 1 year.

However, as patients age, their risk for malignancy increases significantly. Therefore, stable patients older than 50 years of age with rectal bleeding, regardless of their symptoms or family history, should receive a colonoscopy to rule out malignancy. Patients younger than 50 with warning signs of colon cancer (abnormal bowel habits, weight loss, family history of colon cancer, iron deficiency anemia) should also be evaluated with a colonoscopy. Often, colonoscopy is performed routinely at the age of 50 or 10 years prior to the age of presentation for malignancy in family members (whichever is sooner). Of note, even if there is an apparent cause for a lower GI bleed in patients 50 or older (such as hemorrhoids) colonoscopy is still indicated to rule out malignancy.\n\nBarry et al. note the guidelines for colon cancer screening. They note the different age cutoffs.

Once a patient has failed treatment with multiple medications (at least 2) from different classes, the next best step in management is clozapine. This medication is reserved for patients who have sustained treatment failure (because of the side effects of clozapine).

On cranial nerve exam, his left pupil is 6 mm in diameter compared to 3 mm on the right. His left eye is displaced laterally and downward and he also has left-sided ptosis. Strength is 2/5 in the right upper and right lower extremities and 5/5 in the left upper and left lower extremities. He has marked right-sided dysdiadochokinesia. Sensation is intact throughout. Which of the following regions of his brain is most likely affected?", "answer": "Midbrain", "options": {"A": "Lateral medulla", "B": "Lateral pons", "C": "Medial pons", "D": "Midbrain", "E": "Posterior limb of internal capsule"}, "answer_idx": "D", "reason": "This patient with a history of poorly controlled hypertension, acute onset of left-sided oculomotor nerve palsy (mydriasis, ptosis, and \u201cdown and out\u201d pupil), right-sided paresis, and right-sided dysdiadochokinesia most likely has a lacunar stroke of the left midbrain.\n\nImportant structures in the midbrain often affected by stroke include the oculomotor nucleus, substantia nigra, corticospinal tract, red nucleus, and superior cerebellar peduncle. Occlusions to branches of the basilar artery lead to infarctions of various parts of the midbrain. Midbrain lesions almost always manifest with an ipsilateral oculomotor palsy (ptosis from the levator palpebrae muscle; mydriasis from loss of parasympathetic inflow; abduction and excyclotorsion of the globe from the superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior obliques). There may also be contralateral ataxia (cerebellar peduncle after decussation and red nucleus), contralateral hemiparesis (corticospinal tract before decussation at the medulla), and parkinsonian tremor (substantia nigra).\n\nSciacca et al. review the anatomy and clinical signs of strokes of the midbrain, pons, and medulla. They discuss how a stroke of the midbrain will present with oculomotor palsy and paresis. They recommend being vigilant for symptoms of strokes to allow for early diagnosis.\n\nIncorrect Answers:\nAnswer A: Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) is usually due to a stroke of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This presents with ipsilateral ataxia, loss of pain and temperature sensation in the face, dysarthria, and Horner syndrome, as well as contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without dysarthria, lateral medullary syndrome is less likely.\n\nAnswer B: Lateral pontine syndrome can be caused by interruption of blood supply by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. It presents with ipsilateral limb and gait ataxia, ipsilateral Horner syndrome, ipsilateral facial hemianesthesia, ipsilateral facial paralysis, nystagmus and vertigo, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature in the body. In this patient with intact sensorium and without facial paralysis, vertigo, and oculomotor palsy, midbrain stroke is more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer C: Medial pontine syndrome can be due to occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar artery and disrupts the abducens nerve, the dorsal column-medial lemniscus, and the corticospinal tract. This results in contralateral spastic hemiparesis, ipsilateral lateral rectus paralysis (eye turned down and in), and contralateral loss of vibration and stereognosis. In this patient with ptosis, and an eye turned down and out, oculomotor palsy and a midbrain stroke are more likely than a pontine stroke.\n\nAnswer E: Strokes of the posterior limb of the internal capsule lead to contralateral hemiparesis. Strokes of the internal capsule would not be expected to lead to oculomotor nerve palsy or dysdiadochokinesia. The constellation of ataxia, hemiparesis, and cranial nerve palsy is more suggestive of a brainstem pathology than of a lacunar stroke in the internal capsule.\n\nBullet Summary:\nMidbrain strokes commonly present with ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis/hemiplegia, contralateral hemiataxia, and/or contralateral tremor.", "realidx": 306, "cleanse_cot": "The problem presents a clinical scenario involving a 67-year-old man with specific neurological symptoms and asks which region of the brain is most likely affected.
