This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, this is not very severe.\r\nRh is short for the \"rhesus\" antigen or blood type. People are either positive or negative for this antigen. If the mother is Rh-negative and the baby in the womb has Rh-positive cells, her antibodies to the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and cause very severe anemia in the baby. It can be prevented in most cases.Anti-c, clinically the most important Rh antibody after anti-D, may cause severe HDN. Anti-C, anti-E, and anti-e do not often cause HDN, and when they do, it is usually mild.\r\nThere are other, much less common, types of mismatch between minor blood group antigens.
